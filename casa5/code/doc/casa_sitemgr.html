<p>
To move from AIPS++ to CASA in place do the following:
<p>

<ul>
<li><pre>cd $AIPSROOT</pre>
<li><pre>rm -rf code or mv code code.aips++</pre>
<li><pre>cvs checkout -d code casa/code</pre>
<li><pre>cd code/install</pre>
<li><pre>gmake</pre>
<li>Adjust local makedefs to remove the libaips and libtrial lines and
    to add additional lib lines for static/shared builds as
    needed. The new libraries (with their default build definitions)
    are listed below. Only if a library needs to be built differently,
    its line needs to be added to the local makedefs.
     
    <pre>
#                      C++            C          FORTRAN
#                   dbg    opt    dbg    opt    dbg    opt
#                 ------------- ------------- -------------
LIBcasa        := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBscimath     := defeat static defeat defeat defeat static
LIBtables      := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBmeasures    := defeat static defeat defeat defeat static
LIBfits        := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBgraphics    := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBlattices    := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBcoordinates := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBcomponents  := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBimages      := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBms          := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBmsvis       := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBcalibration := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBionosphere  := defeat static defeat defeat defeat static

LIBsimulators  := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBsynthesis   := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
LIBtasking     := defeat static defeat defeat defeat defeat
    </pre>
    Please note that scimath, measures and coordinates contain
    Fortran libraries (for math, sofa, and pim, respectivily).
<p>
<li><pre>inhale.cvs -c</pre>
Alternatively, do a fresh "consortium" install into a "casa" directory
<p>
    
<li>If the runtests are done in a cron job, it might need to be
    changed. Formerly runtests.sh produced four summary files (for
    aips, trial, display and trialdisplay) which are usually emailed
    to aips2-testing@nrao.edu in the cron job.
    Now there are 21 such files which are combined in a single
    runtests.summary file. It contains
    the number of succeeding and failing test programs only.
    It is sufficient to email this file.
<p>
<li>
    AIPS++ has always been built with explicit template instantiation.
    For example, for the gcc compiler the option
    -fno-implicit-templates is usually part of the local makedefs.
    Now that the STL library will be used more and more, it is better
    to build AIPS++ with implicit template instantiation. This can be
    achieved by removing -fno-implicit-templates from C++STD and
    adding -DAIPS_AUTO_STL to CPPSTD.
    <br>Note that AIPS++ templates still need to be instantiated
    explicitly, because their implementations are not part of the .h
    files (as is the case for the STL templates).
</ul>

transition, please contact aips2-requests@nrao.edu
