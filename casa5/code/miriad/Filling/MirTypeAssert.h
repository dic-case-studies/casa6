// <synopsis>
// This exception is used to indicate that certain assumptions about the size
// of primitive types do not hold.  Miriad IO in aips++ assumes that the sizes 
// of casacore::Int, casacore::Float, and casacore::Double are equal to the corresponding sizes of int, float,
// and casacore::Double; this exception is thrown when these conditions are not met.
//
// Normally, applications do not create and throw this exception directly as
// it has been integrated into the MirTypeAssert class which
// automatically checks the memory assumptions upon construction.  Any class
// that depends on this assumption can inherit from MirTypeAssert.  
// </synopsis>
