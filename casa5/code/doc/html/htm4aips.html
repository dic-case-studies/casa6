<H2>1. <A NAME="WHY">Why hypertext?</A></H2> 
 
<P>Hypertext is attractive for documentation systems that have a wide
variety of users, whether at multiple institutes (via the Internet) or
within one organization (via an Intranet).  Hypertext lets users
explore documentation along individualized paths, navigating it in
ways that match their interests or their level of understanding.
Using HTML and the World-Wide-Web, hypertext also provides rapid
publication and updating of information to users around the world.</P>

<P>Hypertext browsers can also serve information on-screen in ways
that can be coupled to software, allowing interaction with user
inputs.  Tutorial documents can be integrated with on-line "applets",
or with form-based interfaces to larger software packages.  This
allows text-based tutorials to be integrated with short "multimedia"
demonstrations, access to databases, even fully-developed user
interfaces to complex software packages.</P>

<HR> 

<H2><A NAME="WHATISHTML">2. What is HTML?</A></H2>

<P>HTML is the Hypertext Markup Language, a method originated at CERN
for formatting and linking documents, images and other information
using tags enclosed in &lt;angle brackets&gt;.  When allied with
graphical browsers for displaying it on a wide range of computers,
HTML became the basis for the rapid growth of the World-Wide-Web.
This growth also saw the proliferation of browser-specific dialects of
HTML; many of these provided "extensions" that are attractive to
commercial Web sites, but are not standardized.  The existence of
these HTML dialects has encouraged some documenters to develop for
particular WWW browsers, reducing inter-operability (but sometimes
gaining commercial advantage).</P>

<P>While the Balkanization of HTML has been an attractive strategy for
some commercial ventures, inter-operability based on global standards
is usually more important in the long run for technical documentation.
Developing for the <em>browser du jour</em> is rarely a good strategy
relative to maximizing the portability of technical documentation at a
multi-user facility like an observatory.  What, then, are the
long-term HTML Standards?</P>

<H3><A NAME="LEVELS">HTML Levels and Standards</A></H3> 

<H4>HTML Level 1</H4>

<P><kbd>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.html</kbd>
documents the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.html">Level 1
specification</A>.  This initial level did not support forms (data
entry), scalable tables, formulae or scientific symbols.  It was
written by Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN and Dan Connolly while at
Convex Computer Corp.  </P>

<H4>HTML Level 2</H4>

<P>This level included forms for user input, but does not support
scalable tables, formulae, or scientific symbols.</P>

<P><kbd>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_toc.html</kbd>
is the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec">
Level 2 draft specification</A>. It is now under final review by the
<A HREF="ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/index.html">HTML Working
Group</A> of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  </P>

<P>Many browsers, including NCSA Mosaic and Netscape Navigator, use
features of HTML Level 2.  Some also use proprietary features that are
not part of this standard. Netscape Navigator supports <EM>ad hoc</EM>
<A
HREF="http://www.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/html_extensions.html">extensions</A>
to HTML 2.0 which are known informally as <A
HREF="http://www.december.com/html/spec/mozilla.html">NHTML</A>.
Although their authors "expect" some of these to be part of future
standards, other browsers may ignore them.  To maximize portability,
avoid using such browser-specific HTML features that are not part of
the Level 2 draft standard.  </P>

<P>Unfortunately, HTML Level 2 cannot directly display characters
outside the ISO 8879-1986 Latin character set, nor can it format
resizable Tables.  Its character set contains a few <A
HREF="http://www.webcom.com/html/tutor/entities/iso8859-1.html">non-Latin
entities</A> that are used by scientists and engineers, but not all
browsers interpret them all correctly.  Until its math standard is
agreed on and implemented (at some future stage of development of
Level 3), HTML is therefore ill-adapted for some scientific writing.
</P>

<H4>HTML Level 3</H4>

<P>The <A
HREF="http://www.hpl.hp.co.uk/people/dsr/html/CoverPage.html" >Level
3.0 draft</A> included such norms of technical documentation as
resizable tables, captioned figures and mathematical equations.  It
also allowed more flexible layout control (e.g. text flowing around
figures), and supported links to common multimedia formats such as
sound sequences and MPEG movies.  Level 3.0, sometimes called <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_1.html">
HTML+</A>, was never widely deployed in browsers, however.</P>

<P> Some parts of the proposed standard were supported by Netscape
Navigator (1.1 and higher) and by NCSA Mosaic, but Netscape in
particular adopted its own <A
HREF="http://www.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/html_extensions_3.html">extensions
</A> to the Level 3.0 specification.</P>

<P><kbd>http://webreference.com/html3andns/</kbd> has a particularly clear
discussion of the differences between HTML 3.0 and NHTML: <A
HREF="http://webreference.com/html3andns/">"HTML 3.0 and Netscape 3.0:
How to tame the wild Mozilla"</A>.</P>

<P>In May 1996, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT, in
consultation with vendors including IBM, Microsoft, Netscape
Communications, Novell, SoftQuad, Spyglass and Sun Microsystems,
announced a new <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Wilbur/">HTML
3.2 specification</A>.  This specification, code named Wilbur, adds
such already-deployed features as tables, Java applets and text flow
around images while providing backward compatibility with Level 2.
It will also provide extensions for multimedia objects, scripting,
style sheets, improved layout, higher quality printing and math.  
There is some hope that the Level 3.2 specification, having been
developed with more input from the commercial browser-writers,
has a better chance of deployment than the ill-fated
Level 3.0.</P>

<P>  Microsoft's <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">Internet Explorer</A>
Version 3.0 uses a <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/htmlext/">variant</A>
of the HTML 3.2 specification.  </P>

<P>W3C's demonstration browser for Level 3 is called <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Arena/">Arena</A>.  It is
available for Linux, Solaris, SunOS, Dec and SGI systems.  Although
still somewhat buggy, even using its own demonstration files(!), Arena
illustrates future possibilities for documentation using HTML 3.  A <A
HREF="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~tzoq/HTML3/">demonstration of Arena's
capabilities</A> (as screen dumps viewable on other browsers) is
available at <kbd>http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~tzoq/HTML3/</kbd>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="GENERATING">3. Generating HTML</A></H2> 

<H3><A NAME="LATEX">HTML from TeX or LaTeX</A></H3>

<P>Most existing documents on concepts, algorithms, instruments and
mathematical methods that are relevant to astronomers are written in
TeX or LaTeX.  Because LaTeX-based packages are used to prepare and
submit scientific articles to journals, Most scientists who will
contribute to astronomical documentation systems are also more
familiar with LaTeX than with HTML.  Finally, TeX and LaTeX are well
suited to the mastering and printing of large documents such as
manuals, lecture notes and conference proceedings. </P>

<P>We can therefore expect to ingest much TeX/LaTeX material when
constructing astronomical documentation in HTML.  This process must be
automated at least to the point where only minor hand-work is needed
to bring scientific text and graphics into the documentation
system. </P>

<P>We will probably need several approaches for this for most of
the 1990's.  </P>

<UL>
 
<LI>One is to convert whole TeX and LaTeX documents directly to
PostScript files that can be displayed by WWW-compatible browsers.
They can be referenced (jumped to) from HTML documents in a
documentation system but cannot directly refer back (re-link) to the
HTML-based system. This route is trivial to implement.  It is suitable
for "one-way" access to entire symbol-rich documents. The original
document's format is preserved, whatever its merits.  </LI>

<LI>Another is to convert as much as possible of the incoming TeX or
LaTeX document directly to HTML. Links between the new document and
the rest of the documentation system can then be two-way.  The new
document can then participate fully in a hypertext structure.  New
linkages can also be created within a long incoming document, making
it easier to browse on-line.  </LI>

</UL> 

<P>The first approach is straightforward but does not integrate
incoming documents fully into a hypertext system.  The second lacks a
<EM>robust</EM> implementation, and may continue to do so until the
Level 3.0 standard has been around for a while. Its most plausible
vehicle at the moment is <A
HREF="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html/latex2html.html"
>LaTeX2HTML</A> (see
<kbd>http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html/latex2html.html</kbd>)
by Nikos Drakos of Leeds University.  Tests of LaTeX2HTML on LaTeX
files from the NRAO astronomy documentation have revealed detailed problems
with this converter, however.  It is unable to parse some perfectly
correct TeX constructs and can produce incorrect results, including
symbol substitutions and garbled equations.  Even if the translator
was bug-free, some problems of principle would remain from this
method's use of "transparent" images (GIF 89 format) to represent
symbols and equations in the original.  This approach has several
disadvantages:</P>

<UL> 

<LI>Some Web browsers open a separate http session for every image
that is embedded in the document. This can make a complicated document
slow to load. </LI>

<LI>Using many GIF images in a document source file also makes it
clumsy to edit as an HTML document.  It is more attractive for the
LaTeX version to remain as the master.  The conversion, which can
be time-consuming for a large document, must be repeated as the
document evolves.</LI>

<LI>The images cannot be resized at the browser.  The output document
looks reasonable only with a limited range of font sizes and styles
selected in the browser - which may not include the reader's usual
default.  Aligning characters between images and text is an ongoing
problem and solutions tend to be browser-specific (non-portable). 
</LI> 

</UL> 

<P>Eventually, the HTML standard will allow mathematical and
Greek symbols to be incorporated directly as HTML elements.  Our
technical documentation should use the standard as soon as it is settled and is
available in a competent, low-cost browser.  Until this happy state of
affairs is realized, LaTeX-to-HTML conversion of scientific documents
should probably be limited to those that demand two-way
links (to and from) the rest of a documentation system.</P>
 
<H3><A NAME="EDITORS">From scratch</A></H3>  

<P>HTML files can be generated using any editor that emits ASCII files.
 There is no reason in principle not to write them in emacs, Word Perfect
or Microsoft Word, once the author either:</P> 

<UL>

<LI>is familiar enough with the HTML standard to type directly in
conformity with it, or</LI>

<LI>has a macro package or output filter that translates into standard
HTML from the editing session. Examples are the www-mode or <A
HREF="http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/">HTML-helper</A> mode for
emacs, various wp2html filters for Word Perfect, and the <A
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msword/fs_wd.htm">Internet
Assistant</A> for Microsoft Word. </LI>

</UL>

word-processor formats to HTML</A> is kept at
<kbd>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Tools/Word_proc_filters.html</kbd>.
</P>

<P>Several specialized tools that can simplify writing HTML  from
scratch are worth attention, however:</P> 

<UL>

<LI><STRONG><A
HREF="http://www.sq.com/products/hotmetal/hmp-org.htm">HoTMetaL</A></STRONG> by <A
HREF="http://www.sq.com/">SoftQuad Inc.</A> is an SGML-compliant
editor for HTML with many tools for authoring valid HTML structures.
Both the freeware and Pro (registered) versions run under MS-Windows
or X-Windows.  Its advantages are:

<UL>

<LI>rigorous rule-checking: it is almost impossible to generate invalid
HTML so it is a good, if stern tutorial on the language as well an
editor</LI>

<LI>it has both a WYSIWYG mode and one that displays HTML tags in
easily-recognized boxes, showing the structure of the file clearly</LI>

<LI>structure-based editing tools speed many operations</LI>

<LI>it can be used to standardize non-compliant HTML</LI>

</UL>

 Its disadvantages are:<UL>

<LI>it can be hard to read highly non-compliant HTML into the freeware
version.  (Some  users complain that "HTML files that display o.k. under
NCSA Mosaic or Netscape Navigator cannot be read in".  Such files
contain invalid elements that the browsers ignore or replace "on the
fly", so they are subject to the whims of browser-writers.) The Pro
version  has  several filters for standardizing non-compliant files and
is easier to use than the freeware version.  </LI>

<LI>needs a lot of memory (4Mb barely supports the freeware, the Pro
version must have 6 Mb)</LI>

<LI>can be slow on simple cut-and-paste operations</LI>

</UL>

Writing standardized HTML is a good way to optimize the output across
the space of all competent browsers.  This is a better strategy than
optimizing for a favored browser that may be unsupported, or merely
unpopular, a few months ahead.  There are other rules-checkers for
HTML <A HREF="#CHECKING">(see below)</A>, but HoTMetaL may contain
the best that is integrated with an editor.  The Pro version of
HoTMetaL includes a spelling checker, thesaurus and macro creator and
has special filters for use with Netscape Navigator's HTML extensions.</LI>
 
<LI><STRONG><A HREF="http://cs.dal.ca/ftp/htmlasst/htmlafaq.html">HTML
Assistant</A></STRONG> by Howard Harawitz is a free HTML editor
for MS-Windows.  It provides a convenient button bar for
inserting HTML elements into a document, and a URL cataloger based on
browser bookmark files.  It does not check rules for incoming or
outgoing documents, so it is superficially more benign than HoTMetaL.
It may have a role for people who want to speed up generating HTML
without worrying about the niceties of standardization.  The freeware
version is limited to files about 62k in size, a Pro version removes
this limitation.  </LI>

rules-checking, but has a simple "test" interface for viewing the
current file with the browser(s) of your choice.  It is a good, fast
tool for small machines once you know the HTML rules well. </LI>

<H3><A NAME="CHECKING">Checking HTML</A></H3>  

<P>As noted above, HTML files are plain text files that can be
generated by any editor. HTML checkers make sure that all tags in HTML
files are placed and nested meaningfully, and that the files contain
all the required information.  Simply reading an HTML file into
someone`s favorite browser is <EM>not</EM> a good way to check it for
validity, and certainly does not imply portability!  The fluid nature
of the standards beyond Level 2, and the enthusiasm of browser-writers
for extending them or ignoring them, means that what looks valid or
beautiful to one browser need not be conforming HTML that will display
sensibly on another.  </P>

<P>The HTML standard also contains features
that are not required and are disregarded by many of the currently
popular browsers but which will be turned on by more advanced browsers
and indexing systems as the worldwide use of HTML matures.  For
example, the &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; tags are not required by
most browsers but are worth including as they can be used to speed up
document-indexing systems.  The use of an &lt;HTML&gt; container tag
for the entire document is optional but may be used by future browsers
to positively identify the file as one that is to be interpreted using
the HTML Document Type Definition (DTD). </P>

<LI><STRONG><A HREF="http://www.sq.com/hmpro.html">HoTMetal
Pro</A></STRONG>, an X/MS-Windows editor, interprets the HTML standard
more strictly than most browsers, and can be set to ignore speculative
browser-specific extensions.  A severe, but ultimately satisfactory,
way to check HTML for cross-platform validity is to read it into
HoTMetaL and correct anything that HoTMetaL complains about. HoTMetaL
also has the attractive feature that it will <EM>fully</EM>
standardize almost-compliant files that are read into it, for example
adding the currently optional &lt;/P&gt; tags where appropriate to
close paragraph-container elements.  Documents written out by HoTMetaL
will also contain the SGML &lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt; prologue that is
recommended in the HTML standard to name the parsing DTD explicitly.

<H2><A NAME="CONVERTING">4. Converting HTML to other
formats</A></H2>
  
<P>The advantages of hypertext and browser-based documentation do not
eliminate the need for printed documents. Not all readers prefer
navigating the multi-linear structures of hypertext to the logical
sequencing implicit in a printed manual.  Not all browsing of
documentation is done at a computer workstation.  Documenters must
still consider how to produce traditional printed manuals from any
hypertext systems.  Originating the documents as TeX or LaTeX or in a
word-processor such as Microsoft Word or Word Perfect alleviates this
problem, but there are also some options for documents that originate
as HTML, or whose hypertext versions may have evolved away from a
printable original. </P>

<P>There are several choices for dumping HTML files to PostScript for printing as
pages or chapters of manuals:</P>
  
<UL>

<LI>Netscape Navigator's print option produces reasonable-looking
PostScript from HTML sources (including in-line images) but has no
facility to paginate it (i.e. to number the pages or to force page
breaks at sensible places).  The most recent versions of NCSA Mosaic
(2.7b4) offer pagination, timestamping, and the ability to record
URL's from the document in the printout as footnotes.  <PRE> </PRE>

<LI>Jan Karrman at Uppsala University has written a stand-alone
HTML-to-PostScript converter called <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.tdb.uu.se/pub/sources/html2ps/html2ps_0.1beta.tar">html2ps</A>.
This is a Perl script that offers considerable control over the final
output, including margins, font selection and sizes.  It lets you
insert page numbers, an important option for long documents.  It has
rudimentary features for concatenating multiple HTML files into one
Postscript file.  It does not yet support in-line images, the
&lt;ISINDEX&gt; tag, or forms. It defaults to A4 page size but has
switches that can be set appropriately for U.S. paper sizes.
Reasonable Postscript can be produced on U.S. letter paper directly
from HTML files by the command
