Summary:
    Attach the ms tool to a measurement set table

Description:


Use this function when you have detached (using the close function)
the ms tool from a measurement set table and wish to reattach to another
measurement set table.

If check=true, additional referential integrity checks on the MS
are run. If any of these fail, an exception is thrown and the MS
is not open (since it is not a valid MS).


Input Parameters:
    thems                     Name of the measurement set table to open.
    nomodify                  Prevent changes to the measurement set.
    lock                      Lock the table for exclusive use by this tool.
    check                     Run additional internal integrity checks on the MS.

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.close()
ms.open('anotherms', nomodify=False, lock=False)

Summary:
    Detach the ms tool from the measurement set table

Description:


This function detaches the ms tool from the associated
measurement set table after flushing all the cached changes.
After calling this function the ms tool is not associated with
any measurement set and using any function other than open or fromfits
will result in an error message being sent to the logger.

This function can be useful to avoid synchronization problems
which can occur when different processes have the same ms open.

Summary:
    Read values from the measurement set. 

Description:


This function reads the specified items from the currently
selected measurement set and returns them in fields of a record.
The main difference between this and direct access of the table,
using the table tool, is that this function reads data from the
selected measurement set, provides access to derived
quantities like amplitude and flag_sum, and can reorder the
data.

As with the ms.range function, the items to read are specified
using a vector of strings. Allowable items include: 'amplitude',
'corrected_amplitude', 'model_amplitude', 'ratio_amplitude',
'residual_amplitude', 'obs_residual_amplitude', 'antenna1',
'antenna2', 'axis_info', 'data', 'corrected_data', 'float_data',
'model_data', 'ratio_data', 'residual_data',
'obs_residual_data', 'feed1', 'feed2', 'field_id', 'flag',
'flag_row', 'flag_sum', 'ha' (added to 'axis_info'),
'ifr_number', 'imaginary', 'corrected_imaginary',
'model_imaginary', 'ratio_imaginary', 'residual_imaginary',
'obs_residual_imaginary', 'last' (added to 'axis_info'),
'phase', 'corrected_phase', 'model_phase', 'ratio_phase',
'residual_phase', 'obs_residual_phase', 'real',
'corrected_real', 'ratio_real', 'residual_real',
'obs_residual_real', 'scan_number', 'sigma', 'data_desc_id',
'time', 'ut' (added to 'axis_info'), 'uvw', 'u', 'v', 'w',
'uvdist', and 'weight'. Unrecognized items will result in a
warning being sent to the logger.  Corrected, model, and float
visibilities will result in a warning if these columns do not
exist.  Duplicate items are silently ignored.

Note that 'ha', 'last', and 'ut' must be requested along with
'axis_info' and ifraxis=True.  This data will be found in a
subrecord of the returned record's 'axis_info' with the key in
uppercase.  For example, for 'ut', the data is found in:
rec['axis_info']['time_axis']['UT'].  See more information
about 'axis_info' below.

The record that is returned contains fields that correspond to
each of the specified items. Most fields will contain an array.
The array may be one, two or three dimensional depending on
whether the corresponding row in the measurement set is a
scalar, one-, or two-dimensional. Unless the ifraxis argument
is set to True, the length of the last axis on these arrays
will correspond to the number of rows in the selected
measurement set.

If the ifraxis argument is set to True, the row axis is split
into an interferometer axis and a time axis. For example, a
measurement set with 90 rows, in an array with 6 telescopes (so
that there are 15 interferometers), may have a data array of
shape [4,32,90] if ifraxis is False, or [4,32,15,6] if ifraxis
is True (assuming there are 4 correlations and 32 channels). If
there are missing rows, as will happen if not all
interferometers were used for all time-slots, then a default
value will be inserted.

This splitting of the row axis may not happen for items where
there is only a single value per row. For some items the
returned vector will contain only as many values as there are
interferometers and it is implicit that the same value should
be used for all time slots. The antenna1, antenna2, feed1,
feed2 and ifr_number items fall in this category. For other
items, the returned vector will have as many values as there
are time slots and it is implicit that the same value should be
used for all interferometers. The field_id, scan_number,
data_desc_id, and time items fall into this category.

The 'axis_info' item provides data labelling information. It
returns a record with the following fields: corr_axis,
freq_axis, ifr_axis, and time_axis. The latter two fields are
not present if ifraxis is set to False.

1. The corr_axis field contains a string vector with elements like
'RR' or 'XY' that indicates which polarizations were correlated
together to produce the data. The length of this vector will
always be the same as the length of the first axis of the data
array.

2. The freq_axis field contains a record with two fields, chan_freq
and resolution. Each of these fields contains vectors which
indicate the centre frequency and spectral resolution (FWHM)
of each channel. The length of these vectors will be the same
as the length of the second axis in the data.

3. The ifr_axis field contains fields: ifr_number, ifr_name,
ifr_shortname and baseline. The ifr_number is the same as
returned by the 'ifr_number' item, 1000*antenna1+antenna2.
The ifr_name and ifr_shortname are string vectors containing
descriptions of the interferometer; ifr_name contains the names
of the antenna pair separated by a hyphen, and ifr_shortname
contains the ids of the antenna pair separated by a hyphen.
The baseline is the Euclidian distance in meters between the two
antennas. All of these vectors have a length equal to the number
of interferometers in the selected measurement set, i.e., to the
length of the third axis in the data when ifraxis is True.

4. The time_axis field contains the MJD seconds field and
optionally the HA, UT, and LAST fields. To include the optional
fields, you need to add 'ha', 'last' or 'ut' strings to the list
of requested items. All of the fields in the time_axis record
contain vectors that indicate the time at the midpoint of the
observation and are in seconds. The MJD seconds field is since
0 hours on the day having a modified julian day number of zero
and the rest are since midnight prior to the start of the
observation.

An optional gap size can be specified to visually separate
groups of interferometers with the same antenna1 index (handy
for identifying antennas in an interferometer vs time display).
The default is no gap.

An optional increment can be specified to return data from every
row matching the increment only.

When the average flag is set, the data will be averaged over the
time axis if the ifraxis is True or the row axis i.e., different
interferometers and times may be averaged together. In the
latter case, some of the coordinate information, like
antenna_id, will no longer make sense. When all data to be
averaged is unflagged, the result is the averaged value and the
corresponding flag is False. When all data is flagged, the
result is set to zero and the corresponding flag is True.  When
data to be averaged is mixed (unflagged and flagged), only the
unflagged values are averaged and the flag is set to False.

You need to call selectinit before calling this function.
If you haven't then selectinit will be called for you with
default arguments.

Items prefixed with corrected, model, residual or obs_residual
are not available unless your measurement set has been processed
either with the imager or calibrator tools.


Input Parameters:
    items                     Item names
    ifraxis                   Create interferometer axis if True.
    ifraxisgap                Gap size on ifr axis when antenna1 changes.
    increment                 Row increment for data access.
    average                   Average the data in time or over rows.

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds
to a particular spectral window and polarization setup. It then
gets the correlated amplitude, and the axis information from
this selected measurement set. This is returned in the casapy
variable d. The remainder of the example prints a table of
'hour angle' and corresponding 'correlated amplitude' for the
first channel, correlation and baseline.

Summary:
    Write new values into the measurement set. 

Description:


This function allows you to write values from casapy variables
back into the measurement set table. The main difference between
this and directly accessing the table using the table tool is
that this function writes data to the selected measurement set.

Unlike the getdata function, you can only put items that
correspond to actual table columns. You cannot change the data
shape either so that the number of correlations, channels and
rows (or interferometers/time slots) must match the values in
the selected measurement set. If the values were obtained using
the getdata function with ifraxis argument set to True, then
any default values added to fill in missing
interferometer/timeslots pairs will be ignored when writing
the modified values back using this function.

Allowable items include:  'data', 'corrected_data',
'model_data', 'flag', 'flag_row', 'sigma', and 'weight'.
'float_data' is currently not implemented for putdata.

The measurement set has to be opened for read/write access
(nomodify=False) to be able to use this function.

You need to call selectinit before calling this function.
If you haven't then selectinit will be called for you with
default arguments.

Items prefixed with corrected, model, residual or obs_residual
are not available unless your measurement set has been processed
either with the imager or calibrator tools.


Input Parameters:
    items                     Record with items and their new values

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS', nomodify=False)
ms.selectinit(datadescid=0)
rec = ms.getdata(['weight','data'])
rec['weight'][:,:] = 1
import numpy as np
meanrec = np.mean(rec['data'],axis=None)
print 'Mean data value = ', meanrec
rec['data'][:,:,:] -= meanrec
ms.putdata(rec)

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds
to a particular spectral window and polarization setup. Note
that the measurement set was opened for writing as well as
reading. The third line reads all the weights and the data into
the casapy variable rec. The weights are set to one. The more
obscure syntax is used as typing rec['weight'] = 1 will not
preserve the shape of the weight array. The data then has its
mean subtracted from it. The mean function is defined in the
numpy module. Finally the data is written back into the
measurement set table. (NOTE:  Normally one should not modify
the raw data column.  Such adjustments are more appropriate for
the corrected_data column, if it exists.)

Summary:
    Create a measurement set from a uvfits file

Description:


This function will convert a uvfits file to a measurement set table
and then open the measurement set table. The newly created
measurement set table will continue to exist after the tool has
been closed.

Setting the lock argument to True will permanently lock the table
preventing other processes from writing to the measurement set.
Unless you expect this to happen, and want to prevent it, you
should leave the lock argument at the default value which implies
auto-locking.

Note that the variety of fits files that fromfits is able to
interpret correctly is limited mostly to files similar to those
produced by classic AIPS. In particular, it understands only binary
table extensions for the antenna (AN), frequency (FQ) and source
(SU) information and ignores other extensions.

This function returns True if it successfully attaches the ms tool
to a newly created Measurement Set or False if something went
wrong, like an error in a file name.

NOTE ON WEIGHTS

ms.fromfits() will generate a WEIGHT_SPECTRUM column in which it
will fill the absolute value of the weight associated with each
visibility in the uvfits file.  Negative weights will have the
associated FLAGs set to True. It will compute the associated WEIGHT
value for that MS row to be the sum of the absolute values of the
associated WEIGHT_SPECTRUM values.


Input Parameters:

Summary:
    Convert a measurement set to a uvfits file

Description:


This function writes a uvfits file that contains the data in the
measurement set associated with this tool. The fits file is always
written in floating point format and the data are always stored in
the primary array of the fits file.

IMPORTANT NOTE: In general, some of the data averaging features of
this method have never worked properly. In general, users should
run mstransform to select and average data prior to running
tofits(). The associated input parameters are slowly being
deprecated and removed.

If the measurement set has been imaged or calibrated in CASA, it
may contain additional data columns. You need to select ONE of
these columns to be written to the fits file. The possible
options are:
1. observed     This is the raw data as collected by the telescope. All
interferometric measurement sets must contain this column.
A synonym for 'observed' is 'data'.
2. corrected    This is the calibrated data. A synonym for 'corrected' is
'corrected_data'.
3. model        This is the visibilites that would be measured using
the current model of the sky. A synonym for 'model' is
'model_data'.

The parsing of these strings is case insensitive. If any other
option is specified then the observed data will be written.

By default a single-source uvfits file is written, but if the
measurement set contains more than one field or if you set the
multisource argument to True a multi-source uvfits file will be
written. Because of limitations in the uvfits format you have to
ensure that the data shape is fixed for all the data you intend to
write to one fits file. See the general description of this tool
for how you can select data to meet this condition.

The combinespw argument is used to control whether data from
different spectral windows will be written as different entries in
the fits FQ (frequency) table or combined as different IF's
within one entry in the FQ table. You should normally only set
this to True if you know that the data from different spectral
windows were observed simultaneously, and the data in the
measurement set can be equally divided between all the spectral
windows (i.e. each window should have the same width).  Use of
this switch is recommended for data to be processed in classic
AIPS and difmap (if possible, e.g., standard dual IF observations).

The padwithflags argument is only relevant if combinespw is True.
If true, it will fill in data that is 'missing' with flags to fit
the IF structure.  This is appropriate if the MS had a few
frequency-dependent flags applied, and was then time-averaged by
split.  If the spectral windows were observed at different times,
padwithflags=True will add a large number of flags, making the
output file significantly longer.  It does not yet support spectral
windows with different widths.

The fits GC (gain curve) and TY (system temperature) tables can
be optionally written by setting the writesyscal argument to True.
This is a rather WSRT-specific operation at the moment and may not
work correctly for measurement sets from other telescopes.

One may overwrite the specified output file if it exists by
specifying overwrite=True.

NOTE ON WEIGHTS

If the MS has no WEIGHT_SPECTRUM column, or if it does, but that
column does not contain any data, ms.tofits() will compute the
associated weight it writes to the uvfits file by taking the
associated WEIGHT column value in the MS and dividing it by the
number of channels associated with the spectral window of that
visibility.


Input Parameters:
    fitsfile                  Name of the new uvfits file.
    column                    Data column to write, see above for options.
    field                     Field ids (0-based) or fieldnames to split out.
    spw                       Spectral windows to split.
    baseline                  Antenna names or Antenna indices to select.
    time                      Limit data selected to be within a given time range. Syntax is the defined in the msselection link.
    scan                      Limit data selected on scan numbers. Syntax is the defined in the msselection link.
    uvrange                   Limit data selected on uv distance. Syntax is the defined in the msselection link.
    taql                      For the TAQL experts, flexible data selection using the TAQL syntax.
    writesyscal               Write GC and TY tables.
    multisource               Write in multisource format.
    combinespw                Export spectral windows as IFs.
    writestation              Write station name instead of antenna name.
    padwithflags              If combinespw==True, pad data with flags to fit IFs.
    overwrite                 Overwrite output file if it exists?

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.tofits('3C273XC1.fits', column='DATA');

This example writes the observed data of a measurement set to a
uvfits file.

Summary:
     Test if the MS was imported with option lazy=True in importasdm and optionally change the ASDM reference. 

Description:


If the MS is imported from an ASDM  with option lazy=True, the DATA
or FLOAT_DATA column of the MS is virtual and directly reads the
visibilities from the ASDM. A reference to the original ASDM is
stored with the MS. If the ASDM needs to be moved to a different
path, the reference to it in the MS needs to be updated. This can
be achieved with ms.asdmref().

When called with an empty string (default), the method just reports
the currently set ASDM path.

Return value is a string containing the new path if the path was
successfully set or (in the case abspath was empty) the MS indeed
contains a ASDM reference, i.e. was lazily imported.

If the ASDM does not contain an ASDM reference, the method returns
an empty string. If abspath is not empty and there was an error
setting the new reference, the method throws an exception.


Input Parameters:
    abspath                   New absolute path of the ASDM to be referenced (empty string = report current setting).

Example:

Set the path to the referenced ASDM to
'/home/alma/myanalysis/uid___A12345_X678_X910':

ms.open('uid___A12345_X678_X910.ms',False)
ms.asdmref('/home/alma/myanalysis/uid___A12345_X678_X910')
ms.close()

Test if the MS was imported with lazy=True and therefore references an
ASDM:

ms.open('uid___A12345_X678_X910.ms')
myref = ms.asdmref()
ms.close()
if myref=='':
print 'This MS does not reference an ASDM.'
else:
print 'This MS references the ASDM ', myref

Summary:
    Concatenate two measurement sets

Description:


This function concatenates two measurement sets together.

The data is copied from the measurement set specified in the
msfile arguement to the end of the measurement set attached to the
ms tool. If a lot of data needs to be copied this function may
take some time. You need to open the measurement set for writing
in order to use this function.


Input Parameters:
    msfile                    The name of the measurement set to append.
    freqtol                   Frequency difference  within which 2 spectral windows are considered similar; e.g '10Hz'.
    dirtol                    Direction difference within which 2 fields are considered the same; e.g '1mas'.
    weightscale               Scale the weights of the MS to be appended by this factor. 
    handling                  Switch for the handling of the Main and Pointing tables: 0=standard, 1=no Main, 2=no Pointing, 3=no Main and Pointing, 4=virtual.
    destmsfile                Optional support for virtual concat: empty table (no subtables) where to store the appended MS copy.
    respectname               If true, fields with a different name are not merged even if their direction agrees.

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS', nomodify=False)
ms.concatenate('BLLAC.ms', '1GHz', '1arcsec')
ms.done()

This example appends the data from the BLLAC measurement set to
the end of the 3C273 measurement set. Its going to assume a
frequency tolerance of 1GHz and position tolerance of 1 arcsec in
deciding if the spw and field in the measurementsets are
similar or not.

Summary:
    Concatenate only the subtables of two measurement sets excluding the POINTING table (resulting MAIN and POINTING table not useful)

Description:


This function acts like ms.concatenate() with handling==3 (do not
concatenate the MAIN and POINTING tables). This is useful for
generating, e.g., SPECTRAL_WINDOW and FIELD tables which contain
all used SPW and FIELD ids for a set of MSs without having to
actually carry out a time-consuming concatenation on disk. The MAIN
table in the resulting output MS is that of the original MS, i.e.
it is not touched.


Input Parameters:
    msfile                    The name of the measurement set from which the subtables should be appended.
    freqtol                   Frequency difference  within which 2 spectral windows are considered similar; e.g '10Hz'.
    dirtol                    Direction difference within which 2 fields are considered the same; e.g '1mas'.
    respectname               If true, fields with a different name are not merged even if their direction agrees.

Example:

tb.open('3C273XC1.MS')
tb.copy('TEMP.MS', norows=True)
tb.close()
ms.open('TEMP.MS', nomodify=False)
ms.testconcatenate('3C273XC1.ms', '1GHz', '1arcsec')
ms.testconcatenate('BLLAC.ms', '1GHz', '1arcsec')
ms.done()

This example makes a copy of the structure of an MS and then
appends the subtables data from two measurement sets to the empty
structure. It will assume a frequency tolerance of 1GHz and
position tolerance of 1 arcsec in deciding if the spw and field in
the measurementsets are similar or not.

Description:


This function virtually concatenates two measurement sets together
such that they can later be turned into a multi-MS with
createmultims().

You need to open the measurement set for writing in order to use
this function.


Input Parameters:
    msfile                    The name of the measurement set to append
    auxfilename               The name of a auxiliary file which is needed when more than two MSs are to be concatenated.
    freqtol                   Frequency difference within which 2 spectral windows are considered similar; e.g '10Hz'.
    dirtol                    Direction difference within which 2 fields are considered the same; e.g '1mas'.

Summary:
    make a new ms from a subset of an existing ms, adjusting subtables and indices

Description:


This function splits out part of the MS into a new MS. Time and
channel averaging can be performed in the process (but not in
the same call).

When splitting multiple spectral windows, the parameters nchan,
start, and step can be vectors, so that each spectral window has
its own selection on averaging and number of output channels. But
the option of using only one value for each of these parameters
means that it will be replicated for all the spectral windows
selected.


Input Parameters:
    outputms                  The name of the resulting measurement set
    field                     Fields to include, by names or 0-based ids.  ('' => all).
    spw                       Spectral windows (and :channels) to select.
    step                      Number of input per output channels - Int vector of length 1 or same as spw.
    baseline                  Antenna names or indices to select  ('' => all).
    timebin                   Duration for averaging.  Defaults to no averaging.
    time                      Only use data in the given time range, using the msselection syntax.
    scan                      Only use the scan numbers requested using the msselection syntax.
    uvrange                   Limit data by uv distance using the msselection syntax.

    combine                   Ignore changes in these columns (scan, and/or state) when time averaging.
    correlation               Limit data to specific correlations (LL, XX, LR, XY, etc.).

    obs                       Only use the requested observation IDs.

Example:

ms.open('multiwin.ms')
ms.split('subms.ms', field=[0], spw=[0], nchan=[10],
start=[0], step=[5], whichcol='CORRECTED_DATA')

In this example we split out data from the first field and first
spectral window. The output data will have 10 channels which is
taken from 50 channels from the input data starting at channel 0
and averaging every 5.

ms.open('multiwin.ms')
ms.split('subms.ms', field=[0], spw=[0,1,2,3], nchan=[10],
start=[0], step=[5], whichcol='CORRECTED_DATA')

In this example we split out data from the 1st field and four
spectral windows. The output data will have 4 spectral windows each
of 10 channels which is taken from 50 channels from the input data
starting at channel 0 and averaging every 5.

ms.open('multiwin.ms')
ms.split('subms.ms', field=[0], spw=[0,1,2,3],
nchan=[10,10,30,40], start=[0,4,9,9], step=[1,10,5,2],
whichcol='CORRECTED_DATA')

In this example we split out data from the 1st field and four
spectral windows. There will be four spectral windows in the output
data, with 10, 10, 30 and 40 channels respectively. These are
averages of the input spectral windows. The first output spectral
window will be formed by picking 10 channels, starting at 0 with no
averaging, of the input spwid 0. The second output spectral window
will consists of 10 channels and is formed by picking 100 channels
from spwid 1 of the input data, starting at channel 4, and every
10 channels to make one output channel.

ms.open('WSRT.ms')
ms.split('subms.ms', timebin='20s', whichcol='all',
combine='scan')
ms.close()

This example averages a WSRT MS into 20s bins, selecting whichever
of DATA, MODEL_DATA, CORRECTED_DATA, or FLOAT_DATA, or LAG_DATA is
present.  Normally the bins would not cross scans, but in this MS
the scan number goes up with each integration, making it redundant
enough with time that it would defeat any time averaging.
Therefore the combine parameter forces the SCAN column to be
ignored for setting the bins.

Summary:
    make a new ms from a subset of an existing ms, without changing any subtables

Description:


This function splits out part of the MS into a new MS. Time
averaging can be performed in the process.  Unlike split, the
subtables and IDs (ANTENNA1, DATA_DESCRIPTION_ID, etc.) are never
changed to account for the selection.

As a side effect of that property, partition cannot select by
channel or correlation, or average channels.  It CAN select by
spectral window(s).


Input Parameters:
    outputms                  The name of the resulting measurement set.

Example:

ms.open('multiwin.ms')
ms.partition('partition.ms', field=[0], spw=[1],
whichcol='CORRECTED_DATA')

In this example we partition out data from the first field and
second spectral window.  Only the CORRECTED_DATA data column will
be copied, and it will be written to the DATA column of
partition.ms.

ms.open('multiwin.ms')
ms.partition('partition.ms', field=[0], spw=[0,1,2,3],

In this example we partition out calibrated data from the first field
and four spectral windows.

This example averages a WSRT MS into 20s bins, selecting whichever

present.  Normally the bins would not cross scans, but in this MS
the scan number goes up with each integration, making it redundant

Summary:
    (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED!!!) Summarize the measurement set

Description:


This method will print a summary of the measurement set to the
system logger. The verbose argument provides some control on how
much information is displayed.

For especially large datasets, the cachesize parameter can be
increased for possibly better performance.

This method can also return, in the header argument, a record
containing the following fields:
1. nrow     Number of rows in the measurement set
2. name     Name of the measurement set

DESCRIPTION OF ALGORITHM TO CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF UNFLAGGED ROWS

The number of unflagged rows will only be computed if listunflis
True. The number of unflagged rows (the nUnflRows columns in the
scans and fields portions of the listing) is calculated by summing
the fractional unflagged bandwidth for each row (and hence why the
number of unflagged rows, in general, is not an integer). Thus a
row which has half of its total bandwidth flagged contributes 0.5
rows to the unflagged row count. A row with 20 of 32 channels of
homogeneous width contributes 20/32 = 0.625 rows to the unflagged
row count. A row with a value of False in the FLAG_ROW column is
not counted in the number of unflagged rows.


Input Parameters:
    verbose                   Produce verbose logging output.
    listfile                  Output file.
    listunfl                  List unflagged row counts? If true, it can have significant negative performance impact.
    cachesize                 EXPERIMENTAL. Maximum size in megabytes of cache in which data structures can be held.
    overwrite                 If True, tacitly overwrite listfile if it exists.
    wantreturn                If true, construct a record containing summary info and return it, else return nothing. If you don't need the record and just want the log output, setting this to False will provide a small performance increase.

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
outr=ms.summary(verbose=True)
###print the begining of observation in this ms
print qa.time(qa.quantity(outr['header']['BeginTime'],'d'),

Summary:
    Get the range of values in the measurement set. 

Description:


This function returns the range of values in the currently
selected measurement set for the items specified.

Possible items include 'amplitude', 'corrected_amplitude',
'model_amplitude', 'antenna1', 'antenna2', 'antennas',
'array_id', 'chan_freq', 'corr_names', 'corr_types', 'feed1',
'feed2', 'field_id', 'fields', 'float_data', 'ifr_number'
(1000*antenna1 + antenna2), 'imaginary', 'corrected_imaginary',
'model_imaginary', 'num_corr', 'num_chan', 'phase',
'corrected_phase', 'model_phase', 'phase_dir', 'real',
'corrected_real', 'model_real', 'ref_frequency', 'rows',
'scan_number', 'sigma', 'data_desc_id', 'time', 'times', 'u',
'v', 'w', 'uvdist', and 'weight'.  Note that corrected, model,
and float versions are available only if these columns are
present in the data.

You specify items in which you are interested using a string
vector where each element is a case insensitive item name.  This
function will then return a record that has fields corresponding
to each of the specified items. Each field will contain the
range of the specified item. For many items the range will be
the minimum and maximum values but for some it will be a list of
unique values. Unrecognized items are ignored.

By default the FLAG column is used to exclude flagged data
before any ranges are determined, but you can set useflags=False
to include flagged data in the range.  However, if you average
in frequency, flagging will still be applied.

You can influence the memory use and the reading speed using
the blocksize argument - it specifies how big a block of data
to read at once (in MB). For large datasets on machines with
lots of memory you may speed things up by setting this higher
than the default (10 MB).

For some items, you need to call selectinit to select a portion
of the data with a unique shape prior to calling this function.

Items prefixed with corrected, model, residual or obs_residual
are not available unless your measurement set has been processed
either with the imager or calibrator tools.


Input Parameters:
    items                     Item names.
    useflags                  Use the data flags.
    blocksize                 Set the blocksize in MB.

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.selectinit(datadescid=0)
ms.range(['time','uvdist','amplitude','antenna1'])
#{'amplitude': array([  2.60339398e-02,   3.38518333e+01]),
# 'antenna1': array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,
# 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
# 26]),
# 'time': array([  4.12162940e+09,   4.12164267e+09]),
# 'uvdist': array([   46.26912101,  3727.97385983])}

In this example the minimum and maximum observation times,
uvdistances, data amplitudes are returned as well as a list of
all the antennas in the antenna1 column.

For this dataset the selectinit function did not need to be
called as all the data is of one shape.

Summary:
    List measurement set visibilities

Description:


This tool lists measurement set visibility data under a number of
input selection conditions.  The measurement set data columns that
can be listed are: the raw data, corrected data, model data, and
residual (corrected - model) data.

The output table format is dynamic.  Field, Spectral Window, and
Channel columns are not displayed if the column contents are
uniform. For example, if ``spw = `1' '' is specified, the spw
column will not be displayed.  When a column is not displayed, a
message is sent to the logger and terminal indicating that the
column values are uniform and listing the uniform value.

Table column descriptions:

Date/Time               Average date and time of data sample interval
Intrf                   Interferometer baseline (antenna names)
UVDist                  uv-distance (units of wavelength)
Fld                     Field ID
SpW                     Spectral Window ID
Chn                     Channel number
Correlated polarization Correlated polarizations (eg: RR, LL, XY)

Sub-columns:

Amp                     Visibility amplitude
Phs                     Visibility phase
Wt                      Weight of visibility measurement

Summary:
    Use the MSSelection module for data selection.

Description:


A return value of True implies that the combination of all
selection expressions resulted in a non-Null combined TaQL
expression. False implies that the combined TaQL could not be
formed (i.e. it is Null, and the 'selected MS' will be the same as
the input MS).

The details of selection expressions are desribed in the
MSSelection Memo.

Note that this function can be called multiple times but the
result is cumulative.  Each selection will work on the data
already selected from all previous calls of this function.  Use
the function reset() to reset all selections to NULL (original
dataset).


Input Parameters:
    items                      Record with fields contain the selection expressions. Keys recognized in the record are: 'spw', 'time', 'field', 'baseline', 'scan', 'scanintent', 'polarization', 'observation', 'array', 'uvdist' and 'taql'. 
    onlyparse                  If set to True, expressions will only be parsed but not applied to the MS for selection.  When set to False, a selected MS will also be generated internally.  Default is False.  When only parsing is requested, the selected-MS is the same as the original MS. 

Example:

staql={'field':'3C286', 'spw':'0~7:10~55'};
ms.open(MSNAME);
# For only getting the list of indices
# corresponding to the selection, onlyparse=True
ms.msselect(staql, onlyparse=True);
ndx=ms.msselectedindices();
ndx['field']
Out[5]: array([1], dtype=int32)
:
:
ms.msselect(staql);  # To do the actual selection.
# From this point on, the ms-tool is attached to the selected MS.

Summary:
    Returns ids of the selection used.

Description:


Utility function that will return the ids of the selection used.


Input Parameters:
    vis                       Measurementset for which this selection applies.
    spw                       Spectral Window Ids (0 relative) to select; -1 interpreted as all.
    field                     Field Ids (0 relative) or Field names (msselection syntax and wilcards are used) to select.
    baseline                  Antenna Ids (0 relative) or Antenna names (msselection syntax and wilcards are used) to select.
    time                      Limit data selected to be within a given time range. Syntax is the defined in the msselection link.
    scan                      Limit data selected on scan numbers. Syntax is the defined in the msselection link.
    uvrange                   Limit data selected on uv distance. Syntax is the defined in the msselection link.
    observation               Select data by observation ID(s).  The syntax is the same as for scan numbers.
    polarization              Select data by polarization(s).
    taql                      For the TAQL experts, flexible data selection using the TAQL syntax.

Example:

a= ms.msseltoindex(vis='3C273XC1.MS', field='3C*')
print a['field']
# [0]
print a
#{'antenna1': array([], dtype=int32),
# 'antenna2': array([], dtype=int32),
#  'channel': array([], shape=(0, 0), dtype=int32),
#  'field': array([0]),
#  'scan': array([], dtype=int32),
#  'spw': array([], dtype=int32),
#  'obsids': array([], dtype=int32)}

Field name '3C*', in this case 3C273, corresponds to field id 0.

N.B.: The return values of unspecified fields (like antenna* and
spw in the above example) will be left empty - this does not mean
that selection excludes all antennas!

Some fields (like 'field') are checked against the subtables of
vis, but others are not.  For example, field='123~132' will
produce an error if vis does not have fields 123 to 132, but for
scan and obsids '123~132' would just return an array of integers
from 123 to 132 regardless of whether vis has those scan or
observation IDs. (The difference comes from it being quicker to
check a subtable than the main table.)

Summary:
    Initialize the selection of an ms 

Description:


A measurement set can contain data with a variety of different
shapes (as described in the overall description to this tool).  To
allow functions to return data in fixed shape arrays you need to
select, using this function, rows that contain the same data shape.
You do not need to use this function if all the data in your
measurement set has only one shape.

The DATA_DESC_ID column in the measurement set contains a value
that maps to a particular row in the POLARIZATION and
SPECTRAL_WINDOW subtables. Hence all rows with the same value in
the DATA_DESC_ID column must have the same data shape. To select
all the data where the DATA_DESC_ID value is N you call this
function with the datadescid argument set to N.

It is possible to have a measurement set with differing values in
the DATA_DESC_ID column but where all the data is a fixed shape.
For example this will occur if the reference frequency changes but
the number of spectral channels is fixed. In cases like this all
the data can be selected and this function does not need to be
used.

To return to the completely unselected measurement set, set the
reset argument to True. This will allow you to access the full
range of rows in the measurement set, rather than just the
selected measurement set.

The datadescid must always be a non-negative integer.


Input Parameters:
    datadescid                Data description id.
    reset                     Reset to unselected state.

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.selectinit(datadescid=0)
print ms.range(['uvdist'])
ms.selectinit(reset=True)
print ms.range('uvdist')

In this example we display the range of uv distances for the data
in the specified measurement set (the range 'items' argument is a
list of strings, even if only one item is requested). The first
print statement will only use data where the DATA_DESC_ID column is
0. This will correspond to a specific spectral window and
polarization setup. The second print statement will print the range
of uv distances for all the data in the measurement set (which is
the same in this case).

%feature("docstring", "

Summary:
    Select a subset of the measurement set. 

Description:


This function will select a subset of the current measurement set
based on the range of values for each field in the input record.
The range function will return a record that can be altered and
used as the argument for this function.  A successful selection
returns True. Unrecognized fields are ignored.

Allowable items for select include: 'antenna1', 'antenna2',
'array_id', 'feed1', 'feed2', 'field_id', 'ifr_number', 'rows',
'scan_number', 'data_desc_id', 'time', 'times', 'u', 'v', 'w',
and 'uvdist'.

You need to call selectinit before
calling this function. If you haven't then selectinit will be
called for you with default arguments.

Repeated use of this function, with different arguments, will
further refine the selection, resulting in a successively smaller
selected measurement set. If the selected measurement set does not
contain any rows then this function will return False and send a
warning message in the logger. Otherwise this function will return
True. To undo all the selections you need to use the selectinit
function (with reset=True).


Input Parameters:
    items                     Record with fields of ranges or enumerations

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.selectinit(datadescid=0)
ms.select({'antenna1':[1,3,5],'uvdist':[1200.,1900.]})
ms.select({'time':[4121629420.,4121638290.]})
# Or, convert time strings to seconds:
start = qa.getvalue(qa.convert(qa.quantity('1989/06/27/01:03:40'),
's'))[0]
stop = qa.getvalue(qa.convert(qa.quantity('1989/06/27/03:31:30'),
's'))[0]
rec = {}
rec['time'] = [start, stop]
ms.select(items=rec)

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds to a
particular spectral window and polarization setup. It then selects
all the data where the first antenna in the interferometer is
number one, three or five and where the uv distance is between 1200
and 1900 meters.  Finally it selects all the data which was
observed between 4121629420 seconds and 4121638290 seconds (since
zero hours on the day where the modified Julian day is zero). Since
this time in seconds is quite obscure, use the quanta tool to
convert a date/time string into seconds which can then be used to
perform the same time selection.

The selections are cumulative so that at the end of this example
only data in the specified time range, with the specified,
interferometers, uv distances, spectral window and polarization
setup are selected.

Summary:
    Select a subset of the measurement set. 

Description:


This function will select a subset of the current measurement set
based on the standard TaQL selection string given.

Repeated use of this function, with different arguments, will
further refine the selection, resulting in a successively smaller
selected measurement set. If the selected measurement set does not
contain any rows then this function will return False and send a
warning message in the logger. Otherwise this function will return
True. To undo all the selections you need to use the selectinit
function (with reset=True).  Note that index values used in the
TaQL string are zero-based as are all tool indices.


Input Parameters:
    msselect                  TaQL selection string

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.selectinit(datadescid=0)
ms.select({'antenna1':[0,2,4],'uvdist':[1200.,1900.]})

# {'antenna1': array([2]),
#  'antenna2': array([ 6,  9, 11, 18, 20, 21, 24])}

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds to a
particular spectral window and polarization setup. It then selects
all the data where the first antenna in the interferometer is
number zero, two or four and where the uv distance is between 1200
and 1900 meters.  Finally it uses a query to select all the data
for which the ANTENNA1 column is 2 (this selects the middle antenna
of the previous, zero-based, selection). The selections are
cumulative so that at the end of this example only data in the
specified time range, with the specified, interferometers, uv
distances, spectral window and polarization setup are selected.

Summary:
    Select and average frequency channels 

Description:


This function allows you to select a subset of the frequency
channels in the current measurement set.  This function can also
average, over frequency channels, prior to providing the values to
the user.

Selection on channels is not allowed using either the select or
command functions, as they can only select entire rows in a
measurement set. Channel selection involves accessing only some of
the values in a row. Like all the selection functions, this
function does not change the current measurement but updates the
measurement set selection parameters so that functions like
getdata will return the desired subset of the data.  Repeated use
of this function will overwrite any previous channel selection.

There are four parameters, the number of output channels, the
first input channel to use, the number of input channels to
average into one output channel, and the increment in the input
spectrum for the next output channel. All four parameters need to
be specified.

When all data to be averaged is unflagged, the result is the
averaged value and the corresponding flag is False.  When all data
is flagged, the result is set to zero and the corresponding flag is
True.  When data to be averaged is mixed (unflagged and flagged),
only the unflagged values are averaged and the flag is set to
False.

This function return True if the selection was successful, and
False if not. In the latter case an error message will also be sent
to the logger.

You need to call selectinit before calling this function.
If you haven't then selectinit will be called for you with default
arguments.


Input Parameters:
    nchan                     Number of output channels, positive integer.
    start                     First input channel to use, positive integer.
    width                      Number of input channels to average together, positive integer. 
    inc                        Increment to next (group of) input channel(s), positive integer. 

Example:

ms.fromfits('NGC5921.MS',
'/usr/lib/casapy/data/demo/NGC5921.fits')
ms.selectinit(datadescid=0)
ms.selectchannel(3,2,5,3)
rec = ms.getdata(['data'])

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds to a
particular spectral window and polarization setup. It then selects
on frequency channels to produce 3 output channels, the first
output channel is the average of channels 2,3,4,5,6 in the input,
the second output channel is the average of channel 5,6,7,8,9 and
the third is the average of channels 8,9,10,11,12.

Summary:
    Selection and conversion of polarizations. 

Description:


This function allows you to select a subset of the polarizations
in the current measurement set.  This function can also setup
conversion to different polarization representations.

You specify the polarizations using a string vector. Allowable
strings are include I, Q, U, V, RR, RL, LR, LL, XX, YY, XY,
YX. These string must be specified in upper case. If the
polarizations match those present in the measurement set they will
be selected directly, otherwise all polarizations are read and
then a conversion step is done. If the conversion cannot be done
then an error will be produced when you try to access the data.

This function return True if the selection was successful, and
False if not.

You need to call selectinit before calling this function.
If you haven't then selectinit will be called for you with default
arguments.


Input Parameters:
    wantedpol                 The polarizations wanted.

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.selectinit(datadescid=0)
ms.selectpolarization(['I','V'])
rec = ms.getdata(['data'])

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds to a
particular spectral window and polarization setup. It then selects
the I and V polarizations and when the getdata function is called
the conversion from RR, LL, LR, RL polarizations to I and V occurs.

Summary:
    Compute and set weights based on variance of data.

Description:


IF NOT RUN IN PREVIEW MODE, THIS APPLICATION WILL MODIFY THE
WEIGHT, WEIGHT SPECTRUM, FLAG, AND FLAG_ROW COLUMNS OF THE INPUT
MS. IF YOU WANT A PRISTINE COPY OF THE INPUT MS TO BE PRESERVED,
YOU SHOULD MAKE A COPY OF IT BEFORE RUNNING THIS APPLICATION.

This application computes weights for the WEIGHT and
WEIGHT_SPECTRUM (if present) columns based on the variance of
values in the CORRECTED_DATA or DATA column. If the MS does not
have the specified data column, the application will fail. The
following algorithm is used:

1. For unflagged data in each sample, create two sets of values,
one set is composed solely of the real part of the data values,
the other set is composed solely of the imaginary part of the
data values.
2. Compute the variance of each of these sets, vr and vi.
3. Compute veq = (vr + vi)/2.
4. The associated weight is just the reciprocal of veq. The weight
will have unit of (data unit)^(-2), eg Jy^(-2).

Data are aggregated on a per-baseline, per-data description ID
basis. Data are aggregated in bins determined by the specified
values of the timebin and chanbin parameters. By default, data for
separate correlations are aggregated separately. This behavior can
be overridden by specifying combine='corr' (see below).

RULES REGARDING CREATING/INITIALIZING WEIGHT_SPECTRUM COLUMN

1. If run in preview mode (preview=True), no data are modified and
no columns are added.
2. Else if the MS already has a WEIGHT_SPECTRUM and this column has
been initialized (has values), it will always be populated with
the new weights.  The WEIGHT column will be populated with the
corresponding median values of the associated WEIGHT_SPECTRUM
array.
3. Else if the frequency range specified for the sample is not the
default ('spw'), the WEIGHT_SPECTRUM column will be created (if
it doesn't already exist) and the new weights will be written to
it.  The WEIGHT column should be populated with the
corresponding median values of the WEIGHT_SPECTRUM array.
4. Otherwise the single value for each spectral window will be
written to the WEIGHT column; the WEIGHT_SPECTRUM column will
not be added if it doesn't already exist, and if it does, it
will remain uninitialized (no values will be written to it).

TIME BINNING

One of two algorithms can be used for time binning. If
slidetimebin=True, then a sliding time bin of the specified width
is used. If slidetimebin=False, then block time processing is used.
The sliding time bin algorithm will generally be both more memory
intensive and take longer than the block processing algorithm. Each
algorithm is discussed in detail below.

If the value of timebin is an integer, it means that the specified
value should be multiplied by the representative integration time
in the MS. This integration is the median value of all the values
in the INTERVAL column. Flags are not considered in the integration
time computation. If either extrema in the INTERVAL column differs
from the median by more than 25%, the application will fail because
the values vary too much for there to be a single, representative,
integration time. The timebin parameter can also be specified as a
quantity (string) that must have time conformant units.

Block Time Processing

The data are processed in blocks. This means that all weight
spectrum values will be set to the same value for all points within
the same time bin/channel bin/correlation bin (see the section on
channel binning and description of combine='corr' for more details
on channel binning and correlation binning). The time bins are not
necessarily contiguous and are not necessarily the same width. The
start of a bin is always coincident with a value from the TIME
column, So for example, if values from the time column are [20, 60,
100, 140, 180, 230], and the width of the bins is chosen to be
110s, the first bin would start at 20s and run to 130s, so that
data from timestamps 20, 60, and 100 will be included in the first
bin. The second bin would start at 140s, so that data for
timestamps 140, 180, and 230 would be included in the second bin.
Also, time binning does not span scan boundaries, so that data
associated with different scan numbers will always be binned
separately; changes in SCAN_NUMBER will cause a new time bin to be
created, with its starting value coincident with the time of the
new SCAN_NUMBER. Similar behavior can be expected for changes in
FIELD_ID and ARRAY_ID. One can override this behavior for some
columns by specifying the combine parameter (see below).

Sliding Time Window Processing

In this case, the time window is always centered on the timestamp
of the row in question and extends +/-timebin/2 around that
timestamp, subject the the time block boundaries. Rows with the
same baselines and data description IDs which are included in that
window are used for determining the weight of that row. The
boundaries of the time block to which the window is restricted are
determined by changes in FIELD_ID, ARRAY_ID, and SCAN_NUMBER. One
can override this behavior for FIELD_ID and/or SCAN_NUMBER by
specifying the combine parameter (see below). Unlike the time block
processing algorithm, this sliding time window algorithm requires
that details all rows for the time block in question are kept in
memory, and thus the sliding window algorithm in general requires
more memory than the  block processing method. Also, unlike the
block processing method which computes a single value for all
weights within a single bin, the sliding window method requires
that each row (along with each channel and correlation bin) be
processed individually, so in general the sliding window method
will take longer than the block processing method.

CHANNEL BINNING

The width of channel bins is specified via the chanbin parameter.
Channel binning occurs within individual spectral windows; bins
never span multiple spectral windows. Each channel will be included
in exactly one bin.

The default value 'spw' indicates that all channels in each
spectral window are to be included in a single bin.

Any other string value is interpreted as a quantity, and so should
have frequency units, eg '1MHz'. In this case, the channel
frequencies from the CHAN_FREQ column of the SPECTRAL_WINDOW
subtable of the MS are used to determine the bins. The first bin
starts at the channel frequency of the 0th channel in the spectral
window. Channels with frequencies that differ by less than the
value specified by the chanbin parameter are included in this bin.
The next bin starts at the frequency of the first channel outside
the first bin, and the process is repeated until all channels have
been binned.

If specified as an integer, the value is interpreted as the number
of channels to include in each bin. The final bin in the spectral
window may not necessarily contain this number of channels. For
example, if a spectral window has 15 channels, and chanbin is
specified to be 6, then channels 0-5 will comprise the first bin,
channels 6-11 the second, and channels 12-14 the third, so that
only three channels will comprise the final bin.

MINIMUM REQUIRED NUMBER OF VISIBILITIES

The minsamp parameter allows the user to specify the minimum number
of unflagged visibilities that must be present in a sample for that
sample's weight to be computed. If a sample has less than this
number of unflagged points, the associated weights of all the
points in the sample are set to zero, and all the points in the
sample are flagged.

AGGREGATING DATA ACROSS BOUNDARIES

By default, data are not aggregated across changes in values in the
columns ARRAY_ID, SCAN_NUMBER, STATE_ID, FIELD_ID, and
DATA_DESC_ID. One can override this behavior for SCAN_NUMBER,
STATE_ID, and FIELD_ID by specifying the combine parameter. For
example, specifying combine='scan' will ignore scan boundaries when
aggregating data. Specifying combine='field, scan' will ignore both
scan and field boundaries when aggregating data.

Also by default, data for separate correlations are aggregated
separately. Data for all correlations within each spectral window
can be aggregated together by specifying 'corr' in the combine
parameter.

Any combination and permutation of 'scan', 'field', 'state', and
'corr' are supported by the combine parameter. Other values will be
silently ignored.

STATISTICS ALGORITHMS

The supported statistics algorithms are described in detail in the
imstat and ia.statistics() help. For the current application, these
algorithms are used to compute vr and vi (see above), such that the
set of the real parts of the visibilities and the set of the
imaginary parts of the visibilities are treated as independent data
sets.

RANGE OF ACCEPTABLE WEIGHTS

The wtrange parameter allows one to specify the acceptable range
(inclusive, except for zero) for weights. Data with weights
computed to be outside this range will be flagged. If not specified
(empty array), all weights are considered to be acceptable. If
specified, the array must contain exactly two nonnegative numeric
values. Note that data with weights of zero are always flagged.

EXCLUDING CHANNELS

Channels can be excluded from the computation of the weights by
specifying the excludechans parameter. This parameter accepts a
valid MS channel selection string. Data associated with the
selected channels will not be used in computing the weights.

PREVIEW MODE

By setting preview=True, the application is run in 'preview' mode.
In this mode, no data in the input MS are changed, although the
amount of data that the application would have flagged is reported.

DATA COLUMN

The datacolumn parameter can be specified to indicate which data
column should be used for computing the weights. The values
'corrected' for the CORRECTED_DATA column and 'data' for the DATA
column are supported (minimum match, case insensitive). One may
specify 'residual' in which case the values used are the result of
the CORRECTED_DATA column - model, or 'residual_data' in which
case the values used are the DATA column - model, where model
is the CORRECTED_DATA column if it exists, or if it doesn't,
the virtual source model if one exists, or if that doesn't, then
no model is used and the 'residual' and 'residual_data' cases
are equivalent to the 'corrected' and 'data' cases, respectively.
The last two options are to allow for operation on timescales or
frequency ranges which are larger than that over which the sky
signal is expected to be constant. This situation arises in eg,
OTF mapping, and also perhaps with sources with significant
spectral structure. In cases where a necessary column doesn't
exist, an exception will be thrown and no data will be changed.
NOTE: It is the user's responsibility to ensure that a model has
been set for all selected fields before using datacolumn='residual'
or 'residual_data'.

RETURN VALUE

In all cases, the mean and variance of the set of all weights computed
by the application is reported and returned in a dictionary with keys
'mean' and 'variance'. Weights for which there are corresponding flags
(=True) prior to running the application are excluded from the
computation of these statistics. If the WEIGHT_SPECTRUM values are
available, they are used to compute the statistics, otherwise,
the WEIGHT values are used. The returned statistics are always computed
using the classic algorithm; the value of statalg has no impact on how
they are computed.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

Flagged values are not used in computing the weights, although the
associated weights of these values are updated.

If the variance for a set of data is 0, all associated flags for
that data are set to True, and the corresponding weights are set to
0.

Because data are modified in the input MS, the nomodify parameter
must be set to False when opening the associated MS tool.


Input Parameters:
    combine                   Ignore changes in these columns (scan, field, and/or state) when aggregating samples to compute weights. The value 'corr' is also supported to aggregate samples across correlations.

Summary:
    Set WEIGHT and SIGMA from the scatter of the visibilities

Description:


NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.

This function estimates the noise from the scatter of the
visibilities, sets SIGMA to it, and WEIGHT to SIGMA**-2.

Ideally the visibilities used to estimate the scatter, as selected
by fitspw and fitcorr, should be pure noise.  If you know for
certain that they are, then setting dorms to True will give the
best result.  Otherwise, use False (standard sample standard
deviation).  More robust scatter estimates like the interquartile
range or median absolute deviation from the median are not offered
because they require sorting by value, which is not possible for
complex numbers.

To beat down the noise of the noise estimate, the sample size per
estimate can be made larger than a single spw and baseline.  (Using
combine='spw' is to interpolate between spws with line-free
channels is recommended when an spw has no line-free channels.)
timebin smooths the noise estimate over time.  windowtype sets the
type of time smoothing.

WEIGHT and SIGMA will not be changed for samples that have fewer
than minsamp visibilities.  Selected visibilities for which no
noise estimate is made will be flagged.  Note that minsamp is
effectively at least 2 if dorms is False, and 1 if it is True.


Input Parameters:
    dorms                     How the scatter should be estimated (True -> rms, False -> stddev).
    byantenna                 How the scatters are solved for (by antenna or by baseline).
    sepacs                    If solving by antenna, treat autocorrs separately.
    fitspw                    Line-free spectral windows (and :channels) to get the scatter from. ('' => all)
    fitcorr                   Correlations (V, LL, XX, LR, XY, etc.) to get the scatter from.  ('' => all)
    combine                   Ignore changes in these columns (spw, scan, and/or state) when getting the scatter.
    timebin                   Duration of the moving window over which to estimate the scatter.  Defaults to 0s, with an effective minimum of 1 integration.
    minsamp                   The minimum number of visibilities for a scatter estimate.
    field                     Fields to reweight, by names or 0-based ids.  ('' => all)
    spw                       Spectral windows to reweight.  ('' => all)
    antenna                   Select data based on antenna/baseline.
    timerange                 Select data by time range.
    scan                      Scan numbers to reweight.  ('' => all)
    intent                    Scan intents to reweight.  ('' => all)
    array                     Select (sub)array(s) by array ID number.
    correlation               Correlations (LL, XX, LR, XY, etc.) to reweight.  ('' => all)
    obs                       Observation IDs to reweight.  ('' => all)
    datacolumn                Which data column to calculate the scatter from.

Example:

ms.open('multiwin.ms', nomodify=False)
ms.statwt(fitspw='0:0~123;145~211,2:124~255', field=[0],
spw='0,2')

In this example the noise estimates are separately made from and
applied to spws 0 and 2.

ms.statwt(fitspw='0:0~123;145~211,2:124~255', fitorder=0,
field=[0], combine='spw')
ms.close()

This time the estimate for each baseline is made from the line-free
channels of spws 0 and 2, and applied to all the spws, including 1
(which could be a completely line-filled spw).

Summary:
    Transform spectral data to different reference frame and/or regrid the frequency channels 

Description:


This function permits you to transform the spectral data of your
measurement set to a given reference frame. The present reference
frame information in the MS is examined and the transformation
performed accordingly. Since all such transformations are linear in
frequency, a pure change of reference frame only affects the
channel boundary definitions.

In addition, the function permits you to permanently regrid the
data, i.e. reduce the channel number and/or move the boundaries
using several interpolation methods (selected using parameter
'interpolation'). The new channels are equidistant in frequency (if
parameter 'mode' is chosen to be vrad or freq, or equidistant in
wavelength if  parameter 'mode' is chosen to be vopt or wave). If
'mode' is chosen to be 'chan', the regridding is performed by
combining the existing channels, i.e. not moving but just
eliminating channel boundaries where necessary.

The regridding is applied to the channel definition and all data of
the MS, i.e. all columns which contain arrays whose dimensions
depend on the number of channels. The input parameters are verified
before any modification is made to the MS.

The target reference frame can be set by providing the name of a
standard reference frame (LSRK, LSRD, BARY, GALACTO, LGROUP, CMB,
TOPO, GEO, or SOURCE, default = no change of frame) in parameter
'outframe'. For each field in the MS, the channel frequencies are
transformed from their present reference frame to the one given by
parameter 'outframe'.

If the regridding parameters are set, they are interpreted in the
'outframe' reference frame. The regridding is applied to the data
after the reference frame transformation.


Input Parameters:
    outframe                  Name of the reference frame to transform to (LSRK, LSRD, BARY, GALACTO, LGROUP, CMB, GEO, TOPO, or SOURCE). SOURCE is meant for solar system work and corresponds to GEO + a radial velocity correction (only available for ephemeris objects). If no reference frame is given, the present reference frame given by the data is used, i.e. the reference frame is not changed. The observatory position is taken as the average of all antenna positions. 
    mode                      The quantity (radio velocity (m/s), optical velocity (m/s), frequency (Hz), wavelength (m), or original channels) in which the user would like to give the regridding parameters below ('center', 'chanwidth', 'bandwidth'): vrad, vopt, freq, wave, or chan. 
    restfreq                  Required in case the value of mode is 'vrad' or 'vopt': Rest frequency (Hz) for the conversion of the regrid parameters 'center', 'chanwidth', and 'bandwidth' to frequencies. 
    interpolation              Name of the interpolation method (NEAREST, LINEAR, SPLINE, CUBIC, FFTSHIFT) used in the regridding. Flagging information is combined using 'inclusive or'. 
    start                     Desired lower edge of the spectral window after regridding in the units given by 'mode' and in the reference frame given by 'outframe'. If no value is given, it is determined from 'center' and 'bandwidth'. 
    center                    (Alternative to setting the parameter 'start'.) Desired center of the spectral window after regridding in the units given by 'mode' and in the reference frame given by 'outframe'. If no value is given, the center is determined from 'start' and 'bandwidth' or, if 'start' is not given either, it is kept as it is. 
    bandwidth                 Desired width of the entire spectral window after regridding in the units given by 'mode' and in the reference frame given by 'outframe'. If no value is given or the given width is larger than the bandwidth of the data, the width will be truncated to the maximum width possible symmetrically around the value given by 'center'. 
    chanwidth                 Desired width of the channels in the units given by 'mode' and in the reference frame given by 'outframe'. This implies that channels will be equidistant in the unit given by 'mode'. If no value is given and 'mode' is vrad or freq, the function will keep the resolution as it is. If 'mode' is vopt or wave, the total number of channels will be kept as is. 
    hanning                   If true, perform hanning smoothing before regridding. 

Example:

ms.fromfits('NGC5921.MS','/usr/lib/casapy/data/demo/NGC5921.fits')
ms.regridspw(outframe='LSRK')

This example reads a measurement set and transforms its spectral
axis to the LSRK reference frame.

ms.regridspw(outframe='BARY', mode='vrad',
center=73961800., chanwidth=50., bandwidth=1000.,
restfreq=1420405750e6)

In this example, all spectral windows in the MS will be transformed
to the BARY reference frame and then be regridded such that the
center of the new spectral window is at radio velocity = 73961800.
m/s (BARY). If the bandwidth of the observation is large enough the
total width of the spectral window will be 1000 m/s, i.e. 20
channels of width 50 m/s, 10 on each side of the given center.

ms.regridspw(mode='vopt', restfreq=1420405750e6)

In this example the channels are regridded such that they are
equidistant in optical velocity. The reference frame and number of
channels is kept as is.

ms.regridspw(mode='chan', center=64, chanwidth=2,
bandwidth=102)

In this example, the channels are regridded such that the new
bandwidth is 102 of the original channels centered on the original
channel 64, and the new channels are twice as wide as the original
channels.

Summary:
    Subtract the continuum from the visibilities

Description:


NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET.  uvcontsub uses the cb tool for now.
(The only reason to implement it in ms is to save time and disk
space.)

This function estimates the continuum emission of the MS and writes
a MS with that estimate subtracted, using the ms tool.  The
estimate is made, separately for the real and imaginary parts of
each baseline, by fitting a low order polynomial to the unflagged
visibilities selected by fitspw (depending on combine).


Input Parameters:
    outputms                  The name of the resulting measurement set. 
    fitspw                    Line-free spectral windows (and :channels) to fit to. 
    fitorder                  The order of the polynomial to use when fitting. 
    combine                   Ignore changes in these columns (spw, scan, and/or state) when fitting.
    spw                       Spectral windows (and :channels) to select.
    unionspw                  The union of fitspw and spw, i.e. how much needs to be read. '*' always works, but may be more than you need.
    field                     Fields to include, by names or 0-based ids.  ('' => all)
    scan                      Only use the scan numbers requested using the msselection syntax.
    intent                    Only use the requested scan intents.
    correlation               Limit data to specific correlations (LL, XX, LR, XY, etc.).
    obs                       Only use the requested observation IDs.
    whichcol                  'DATA', 'MODEL_DATA', 'CORRECTED_DATA', and/or 'FLOAT_DATA'

Example:

ms.open('multiwin.ms')
ms.contsub('contsub.ms', fitspw='0:0~123;145~211,2:124~255',
fitorder=0, field=[0], spw='0,2')

In this example the continuum estimates are made by seperately
averaging channels 0:0~123;145~211 and 2:124~255, and the separate
estimates are subtracted from spws 0 and 2.  The output only
includes field 0 and spws 0 and 2 (now called 1).

ms.contsub('contsub.ms', fitspw='0:0~123;145~211,2:124~255',
fitorder=0, field=[0], combine='spw')
ms.close()

This time the estimate was made by simultaneously averaging
channels 0:0~123;145~211 and 2:124~255, and the continuum is
subtracted from all the spws, including 1 (treated as a completely
line-filled spw).  The output only includes field 0.

Summary:
    Continuum fitting and subtraction in uv plane. 

Description:


This function provides a means of continuum determination and
subtraction by fitting a polynomial of desired order to a subset of
channels in each time-averaged uv spectrum.  The fit is used to
model the continuum in all channels (not just those used in the
fit), for subtraction, if desired.

Use the fitspw parameter to limit the spectral windows processed and
the range of channels used to estimate the continuum  in each (avoid
channels containing spectral lines).

The default solution interval 'int' will result in per-integration
continuum fits for each baseline.

The mode parameter indicates how the continuum model (the result of
the fit) should be used:
- 'subtract' will store the continuum model in the MODEL_DATA column
and subtract it from the CORRECTED_DATA column
- 'replace' will replace the CORRECTED_DATA column with the
continuum model (useful if you want to image the continuum model
result)
- 'model' will only store the continuum model in the MODEL_DATA
column (the CORRECTED_DATA is unaffected).

It is important to start the ms tool with nomodify=False so that
changes to the dataset will be allowed (see example below).  For
now, the only way to recover the un-subtracted CORRECTED_DATA
column is to use calibrater.correct() again.

Note that the MODEL_DATA and CORRECTED_DATA columns must be present
for continuumsub to work correctly.  The function will warn the
user if they are not present, and abort.  To add these scratch
columns, close the ms tool, then start a calibrater or an imager
tool, which will add the scratch columns.  Then restart the ms
tool, and try continuumsub again.


Input Parameters:
    field                     Select fields to fit.
    fitspw                    Spectral windows/channels to use for fitting the continuum; default all spectral windows in all channels.
    spw                       Select spectral windows and channels from which to subtract a continuum estimate; default: all channels in all spectral windows for which the continuum was estimated
    solint                    Continuum fit timescale (units optional). 
    fitorder                  Polynomial order for fit.
    mode                      Desired use of fit model (see above).

Example:

ms.fromfits('ngc5921.ms','/aips++/data/demo/NGC5921.fits')
ms.close()
cb.open('ngc5921.ms')  # add MODEL_DATA, CORRECTED_DATA columns
cb.close()
ms.open('ngc5921.ms', nomodify=False);    # writable!
ms.continuumsub(field=2, fitspw='0:5~9;50~59',
solint=0.0, fitorder=1, mode='subtract')
ms.done()

This example will fit a linear continuum to channels 5-9 and 50-59
in spectral window 0 in each scan-averaged spectrum for field 2,
store the result in the MODEL_DATA column, and subtract it from the
CORRECTED_DATA column.

If no newmsname is given, a sorted copy of the MS is written into a
new MS under the name x.sorted (where x is the name of the original
MS). The original MS is then closed and deleted. The new MS is
renamed to the name of the original MS and then reopened.


Input Parameters:

Summary:
    Initialize for iteration over an ms. 

Description:


Specify the columns to iterate over and the time interval to use
for the TIME column iteration.  The columns are specified by their
MS column name and must contain scalar values.

Note that the following default sort columns are always added to
the specified columns: array_id, field_id, data_desc_id and time.
This is so that the iterator can keep track of the coordinates
associated with the data (field direction, frequency, etc.). If you
want to sort on these columns last instead of first, you need to
include them in the columns specified. If you don't want to sort on
these columns at all, you can set adddefaultsortcolumns to False.

You may want to use iteration for a large dataset. After calling
iterinit, you must call iterorigin before attempting to retrieve
data with getdata.

You need to call selectinit before calling this.


Input Parameters:
    columns                   Vector of column names (case sensitive).
    interval                  Time interval in seconds (greater than 0), to group together in iteration.

This method returns True if there are no more iterations left.
I.e., the iterations have ended.  This same information is also
returned by niternext().

With the use of the VisibilityIterator in the niterinit(),
niterorigin(), niternext() methods, the iterator is set to the
original state by calling niterinit() at any time.

Summary:
    Get the range of values in the measurement set

Description:


DEPRECATED: Please use the ms::range() function in place of
ms::rangeold().

This function will return the range of values in the currently
selected measurement set for the items specified.  Possible items
include most scalar columns, interferometer number
(1000*antenna1+antenna2), uvdist(ance), u, v, w, amplitude, phase,
real and imaginary components of the data (and corrected and model
versions of these - if these columns are present). See the table
at the top of the document to find the exact list.

You specify items in which you are interested using a string
vector where each element is a case insensitive item name.  This
function will then return a record that has fields corresponding
to each of the specified items. Each field will contain the range
of the specified item. For many items the range will be the
minimum and maximum values but for some it will be a list of
unique values. Unrecognized items are ignored.

By default the FLAG column is used to exclude flagged data before
any ranges are determined, but you can set useflags=False to
include flagged data in the range.  However, if you average in
frequency, flagging will still be applied.

You can influence the memory use and the reading speed using
the blocksize argument - it specifies how big a block of data
to read at once (in MB). For large datasets on machines with lots
of memory you may speed things up by setting this higher than the
default (10 MB).

For some items, you need to call selectinitold to select a portion
of the data with a unique shape prior to calling this function.

Items prefixed with corrected, model, residual or obs_residual
are not available unless your measurement set has been processed
either with the imager or calibrator tools.


Input Parameters:
    items                     Item names
    useflags                  Use the data flags
    blocksize                 Set the blocksize in MB

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.selectinitold(datadescid=0)
ms.rangeold(['time','uvdist','amplitude','antenna1'])
#{'amplitude': array([  2.60339398e-02,   3.38518333e+01]),
# 'antenna1': array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 11, 12, 13,
#                    14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]),
# 'time': array([  4.12162940e+09,   4.12164267e+09]),
# 'uvdist': array([   46.26912101,  3727.97385983])}

In this example the minimum and maximum observation times,
uvdistances, data amplitudes are returned as well as a list of all
the antennas in the antenna1 column.

For this dataset the selectinitold function did not need to be
called as all the data is of one shape.

Summary:
    Initialize the selection of an ms

Description:


DEPRECATED: Please use the ms::selectinit() function in place of
ms::selectinitold().

A measurement set can contain data with a variety of different
shapes (as described in the overall description to this tool).  To
allow functions to return data in fixed shape arrays you need to
select, using this function, rows that contain the same data
shape. You do not need to use this function if all the data in
your measurement set has only one shape.

The DATA_DESC_ID column in the measurement set contains a
value that maps to a particular row in the POLARIZATION and
SPECTRAL_WINDOW subtables. Hence all rows with the same
value in the DATA_DESC_ID column must have the same data
shape. To select all the data where the DATA_DESC_ID value
is $N$ you call this function with the datadescid argument set to
$N$.

It is possible to have a measurement set with differing values in
the DATA_DESC_ID column but where all the data is a fixed
shape. For example this will occur if the reference frequency
changes but the number of spectral channels is fixed. In cases
like this all the data can be selected, using this function with
an argument of zero.  If the data shape does change and you call
this function with an datadescid set to zero  the return value will be False. In all other cases it
will be True.

To return to the completely unselected measurement set, set the
reset argument to True. This will allow you to access the full
range of rows in the measurement set, rather than just the
selected measurement set.

The datadescid must always be a non-negative integer.


Input Parameters:
    datadescid                Data description id
    reset                     Reset to unselected state

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.selectinitold(datadescid=0)
print ms.rangeold(['uvdist'])
ms.selectinitold(reset=True)
print ms.rangeold('uvdist')

In this example we display the range of uv distances for the data
in the specified measurement set (the range 'items' argument is a
list of strings, even if only one item is requested). The first
print statement will only use data where the DATA_DESC_ID column is
0. This will correspond to a specific spectral window and
polarization setup. The second print statement will print the range
of uv distances for all the data in the measurement set (which is
the same in this case).

Summary:
    Select a subset of the measurement set.

Description:


DEPRECATED: Please use the ms::select() function in place of
ms::selectold().

This function will select a subset of the current measurement set
based on the range of values for each field in the input record.
The rangeold function will return a record that can be altered and
used as the argument for this function.  A successful selection
returns True. Unrecognized fields are ignored.

Allowable items for selectold include:  antenna1, antenna2,
array_id, feed1, feed2, field_id, ifr_number, rows, scan_number,
data_desc_id, time, times, u, v, w, and uvdist.

You need to call selectinitold before
calling this function. If you haven't then selectinitold will be
called for you with default arguments.

Repeated use of this function, with different arguments, will
further refine the selection, resulting in a successively smaller
selected measurement set. If the selected measurement set does not
contain any rows then this function will return False and send a
warning message in the logger. Otherwise this function will return
True. To undo all the selections you need to use the selectinitold
function (with reset=True).


Input Parameters:
    items                     record with fields contain ranges and enumerations

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.selectinitold(datadescid=0)
ms.selectold({'antenna1':[1,3,5],'uvdist':[1200.,1900.]})
ms.selectold({'time':[4121629420.,4121638290.]})
# Or, convert time strings to seconds:
start = qa.getvalue(qa.convert(
qa.quantity('1989/06/27/01:03:40'),'s'))[0]
stop = qa.getvalue(qa.convert(
qa.quantity('1989/06/27/03:31:30'),'s'))[0]
rec = {}
rec['time'] = [start, stop]
ms.selectold(items=rec)

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds to a
particular spectral window and polarization setup. It then selects
all the data where the first antenna in the interferometer is
number one, three or five and where the uv distance is between 1200
and 1900 meters.  Finally it selects all the data which was
observed between 4121629420 seconds and 4121638290 seconds (since
zero hours on the day where the modified Julian day is zero). Since
this time in seconds is quite obscure I have also illustrated how
to use the quanta tool to convert a date/time string into seconds
which can then be used to perform the same time selection.

The selections are cumulative so that at the end of this example
only data in the specified time range, with the specified,
interferometers, uv distances, spectral window and polarization
setup are selected.

Summary:
    Select a subset of the measurement set.

Description:


DEPRECATED: Please use the ms::selecttaql() function in place of
ms::selecttaqlold().

This function will select a subset of the current measurement set
based on the standard TaQL selection string given.

Repeated use of this function, with different arguments, will
further refine the selection, resulting in a successively smaller
selected measurement set. If the selected measurement set does not
contain any rows then this function will return False and send a
warning message in the logger. Otherwise this function will return
True. To undo all the selections you need to use the selectinitold
function (with reset=True). Note that index values used in the TaQL
string are zero-based as are all tool indices.



Input Parameters:
    msselect                  TaQL selection string

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.selectinitold(datadescid=0)
ms.selectold({'antenna1':[0,2,4],'uvdist':[1200.,1900.]})
ms.selecttaqlold('ANTENNA1==2')
ms.rangeold(['ANTENNA1','ANTENNA2'])
# {'antenna1': array([2]),
#  'antenna2': array([ 6,  9, 11, 18, 20, 21, 24])}

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds to a
particular spectral window and polarization setup. It then selects
all the data where the first antenna in the interferometer is
number zero, two or four and where the uv distance is between 1200
and 1900 meters.  Finally it uses a query to select all the data
for which the ANTENNA1 column is 2 (this selects the middle antenna
of the previous, zero-based, selection).  The selections are
cumulative so that at the end of this example only data in the
specified time range, with the specified interferometers, uv
distances, spectral window and polarization setup are selected.

Summary:
    Select and average frequency channels

Description:


DEPRECATED: Please use the ms::selectchannel() function in place of
ms::selectchannelold().

This function allows you to select a subset of the frequency
channels in the current measurement set.  This function can also
average, over frequency channels, prior to providing the values to
the user.

Selection on channels is not allowed using either the select or
command functions as they can only select entire rows in a
measurement set. Channel selection involves accessing only some of
the values in a row. Like all the selection functions this
function does not change the current measurement but updates the
measurement set selection parameters so that functions like
getdataold will return the desired subset of the data.  Repeated
use of this function will overwrite any previous channel selection.

There are four parameters, the number of output channels, the
first input channel to use, the number of input channels to
average into one output channel, and the increment in the input
spectrum for the next output channel. All four parameters need to
be specified.

When all data to be averaged is unflagged, the result is the
averaged value and the corresponding flag is False.  When all data
is flagged, the result is set to zero and the corresponding flag is
True.  When data to be averaged is mixed (unflagged and flagged),
only the unflagged values are averaged and the flag is set to
False.

This function return True if the selection was successful, and
False if not. In the latter case an error message will also be sent
to the logger.

You need to call selectinitold before
calling this function. If you haven't then selectinitold will be
called for you with default arguments.


Input Parameters:
    nchan                     Number of output channels, positive integer
    start                     First input channel to use, positive integer
    width                      Number of input channels to average together, positive integer 
    inc                        Increment to next (group of) input channel(s), positive integer 

Example:

ms.fromfits('NGC5921.MS',
'/usr/lib/casapy/data/demo/NGC5921.fits')
ms.selectinitold(datadescid=0)
ms.selectchannelold(3,2,5,3)

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds to a
particular spectral window and polarization setup. It then selects
on frequency channels to produce 3 output channels, the first
output channel is the average of channels 2,3,4,5,6 in the input,
the second output channel is the average of channel 5,6,7,8,9 and
the third is the average of channels 8,9,10,11,12.

Summary:
    Selection and convertion of polarizations

Description:


DEPRECATED: Please use the ms::selectpolarization() function in
place of ms::selectpolarizationold().

This function allows you to select a subset of the polarizations
in the current measurement set.  This function can also setup
conversion to different polarization representations.

You specify the polarizations using a string vector. Allowable
strings are include I, Q, U, V, RR, RL, LR, LL, XX, YY, XY,
YX. These string must be specified in upper case. If the
polarizations match those present in the measurement set they will
be selected directly, otherwise all polarizations are read and
then a conversion step is done. If the conversion cannot be done
then an error will be produced when you try to access the data.

This function return True if the selection was successful, and
False if not.

You need to call selectinitold before
calling this function. If you haven't then selectinitold will be
called for you with default arguments.


Input Parameters:
    wantedpol                 The polarizations wanted

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
ms.selectinitold(datadescid=0)
ms.selectpolarizationold(['I','V'])
rec = ms.getdataold('data')

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds to a
particular spectral window and polarization setup. It then selects
the I and V polarizations and when the getdataold function is
called the conversion from RR, LL, LR, RL polarizations to I and V
occurs.

Summary:
    Read values from the measurement set.

Description:


DEPRECATED: Please use the ms::getdata() function in place
of ms::getdataold().

This function will read the specified items from the currently
selected measurement set and returns them in fields of a record.
The main difference between this and direct access of the table,
using the table tool, is that this function reads data from the
selected measurement set, it provides access to derived
quantities like amplitude and flag_sum and it can reorder the
data.

The items to read are specified, as with the rangeold function,
using a vector of strings. Allowable items include:  amplitude,
corrected_amplitude, model_amplitude, ratio_amplitude,
residual_amplitude, obs_residual_amplitude, antenna1, antenna2,
axis_info, data, corrected_data, model_data, ratio_data,
residual_data, obs_residual_data, feed1, feed2, field_id, flag,
flag_row, flag_sum, ha (added to axis_info), ifr_number, imaginary,
corrected_imaginary, model_imaginary, ratio_imaginary,
residual_imaginary, obs_residual_imaginary, last (added to
axis_info), phase, corrected_phase, model_phase, ratio_phase,
residual_phase, obs_residual_phase, real, corrected_real,
ratio_real, residual_real, obs_residual_real, scan_number, sigma,
data_desc_id, time, ut (added to axis_info), uvw, u, v, w, uvdist,
and weight. Unrecognized items will result in a warning being sent
to the logger.  Duplicate items are silently ignored.

The record that is returned contains fields that correspond to
each of the specified items. Most fields will contain an array. The
array may be one, two or three dimensional depending on whether the
corresponding row in the measurement set is a scalar, one or two
dimensional. Unless the ifraxis argument is set to True the length
of the last axis on these arrays will correspond to the number of
rows in the selected measurement set.

If the ifraxis argument is set to True, the row axis is split into
an interferometer axis and a time axis. For example a measurement
set with 90 rows, in an array with 6 telescopes (so that there are
15 interferometers), may have a data array of shape [4,32,90]
if ifraxis is False or [4,32,15,6], if ifraxis is True (assuming
there are 4 correlations and 32 channels). If there are missing
rows as will happen if not all interferometers where used for all
time-slots then a default value will be inserted.

This splitting of the row axis may not happen for items where
there is only a single value per row. For some items the returned
vector will contain only as many values as there are
interferometers and it is implicit that the same value should be
used for all time slots. The antenna1, antenna2, feed1, feed2, and
ifr_number items fall in this category. For other items the
returned vector will have as many values as there are time slots
and it is implicit that the same value should be used for all
interefometers. The field_id, scan_number, data_desc_id, and
time items fall into this category.

The axis_info item provides data labelling information. It
returns a record with the following fields: corr_axis, freq_axis,
ifr_axis and time_axis. The latter two fields are not present if
ifr_axis is set to False. The corr_axis field contains a string
vector with elements like 'RR' or 'XY' that indicates which
polarizations where correlated together to produce the data. The
length of this vector will always be the same as the length of the
first axis of the data array. The freq_axis field contains a record
with two fields, chan_freq and resolution. Each of these fields
contains vectors which indicate the centre frequency and spectral
resolution (FWHM) of each channel. The length of these vectors will
be the same as the length of the second axis in the data. The
ifr_axis field contains fields: ifr_number, ifr_name,
ifr_shortname, and baseline. The ifr_number is the same as returned
by the ifr_item, the ifr_name and ifr_shortname are string vecors
containing descriptions of the interferometer and the baseline is
the Euclidian distance, in meters between the two antennas. All of
these vectors have a length equal to the number of interferometers
in the selected measurement set ie., to the length of the third
axis in the data when ifraxis is True. The time_axis field contains
the MJD seconds field and optionally the HA, UT, and LAST fields.
To include the optional fields you need to add the ha, last or ut
strings to the list of requested items. All the fields in the
time_axis record contain vectors that indicate the time at the
midpoint of the observation and are in seconds. The MJD seconds
field is since 0 hours on the day having a modified julian day
number of zero and the rest are since midnight prior to the start
of the observation.

An optional gap size can be specified to visually separate groups
of interferometers with the same antenna1 index (handy for
identifying antennas in an interferometer vs time display). The
default is no gap.

An optional increment can be specified to return data from every
row matching the increment only.

When the average flag is set, the data will be averaged over the
time axis if the ifraxis is True or the row axis i.e., different
interferometers and times may be averaged together. In the latter
case, some of the coordinate information, like antenna_id, will
no longer make sense.  When all data to be averaged is unflagged,
the result is the averaged value and the corresponding flag is
False. When all data is flagged, the result is set to zero and the
corresponding flag is True.  When data to be averaged is mixed
(unflagged and flagged), only the unflagged values are averaged and
the flag is set to False.

You need to call selectinitold before
calling this function. If you haven't then selectinitold will be
called for you with default arguments.

Items prefixed with corrected, model, residual or obs_residual are
not available unless your measurement set has been processed either
with the imager or calibrator tools.

    items                     Item names
    ifraxis                   Create interferometer axis if True

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds to a
particular spectral window and polarization setup. It then gets the
correlated amplitude, and the axis information from this selected

Summary:
    Write new values into the measurement set

Description:


DEPRECATED: Please use the ms::putdata() function in place
of ms::putdataold().

This function allows you to write values from casapy variables back
into the measurement set table. The main difference between this
and directly accessing the table using the table tool is that this
function writes data to the selected measurement set.

Unlike the getdataold function you can only put items that
correspond to actual table columns. You cannot change the data
shape either so that the number of correlations, channels and rows
(or intereferometers/time slots) must match the values in the
selected measurement set. If the values were obtained using the
getdataold function with ifraxis argument set to True, then any
default values added to fill in missing intereferometer/timeslots
pairs will be ignored when writing the modified values back using
this function.

Allowable items include:  data, corrected_data, model_data, flag,
flag_row, sigma, and weight.

The measurement set has to be opened for read/write access to be
able to use this function.

You need to call selectinitold before
calling this function. If you haven't then selectinitold will be
called for you with default arguments.

Items prefixed with corrected, model, residual or obs_residual are
not available unless your measurement set has been processed either
with the imager or calibrator tools.


Input Parameters:

Example:

ms.open('3C273XC1.MS', nomodify=False)

rec = ms.getdataold(['weight','data'])
rec['weight'][:,:] = 1
import Numeric
meanrec = Numeric.average(rec['data'],axis=None)
print 'Mean data value = ', meanrec
rec['data'][:,:,:] -= meanrec
ms.putdataold(rec)

This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This corresponds to a
particular spectral window and polarization setup. Note that the
measurement set was opened for writing as well as reading. The
third line reads all the weights and the data into the variable
rec. The weights are set to one. The more obscure syntax is used as
typing rec['weight'] = 1 will not preserve the shape of the weight
array. The data then has its mean subtracted from it. The average
function is defined in Numeric module. Finally the data is written
back into the measurement set table. (NOTE: normally one should not
modify the raw data column.  Such adjustments are more appropriate
for the corrected_data column, if it exists.)

    Initialize for iteration over an ms

Description:


DEPRECATED: Please use the ms::iterinit() function in place
of ms::iterinitold().

Specify the columns to iterate over and the time interval to use
for the TIME column iteration.  The columns are specified by their
MS column name and must contain scalar values.

Note that the following columns are always added to the specified
columns: array_id, field_id, data_desc_id and time. This is so that
the iterator can keep track of the coordinates associated with the
data (field direction, frequency, etc.). If you want to sort on
these columns last instead of first, you need to include them in
the columns specified. If you don't want to sort on these columns
at all, you can set adddefaultsortcolumns to False.

You may want to use iteration for a large dataset. After calling
iterinitold, you must call iteroriginold before attempting to
retrieve data with getdataold.

You need to call selectinitold before calling this.

Summary:
    Continuum fitting and subtraction in uv plane

Description:


DEPRECATED: Please use the ms::continuumsub() function in place
of ms::continuumsubold().

This function provides a means of continuum determination and
subtraction by fitting a polynomial of desired order to a subset
of channels in each time-averaged uv spectrum.  The fit is used
to model the continuum in all channels (not just those used in
the fit), for subtraction, if desired.  Use the fitspw parameter
to limit the spectral windows processed and the range of channels
used to estimate the continuum  in each (avoid channels
containing spectral lines).  The default solution interval 'int'
will result in per-integration continuum fits for each baseline.
The mode parameter indicates how the continuum model (the result
of the fit) should be used: 'subtract' will store the continuum
model in the MODEL_DATA column and subtract it from the
CORRECTED_DATA column; 'replace' will replace the CORRECTED_DATA
column with the continuum model (useful if you want to image the
continuum model result); and 'model' will only store the
continuum model in the MODEL_DATA column (the CORRECTED_DATA is
unaffected).

It is important to open the dataset with nomodify=False so that
changes will be allowed (see example below).

For now, the only way to recover the un-subtracted CORRECTED_DATA
column is to use calibrater.correct() again.

Note that the MODEL_DATA and CORRECTED_DATA columns must be
present for continuumsubold to work correctly.  The function will
warn the user if they are not present, and abort.  To add these
scratch columns, close the ms tool, then start a calibrater or an
imager tool, which will add the scratch columns.  Then restart
the ms tool, and try continuumsubold again.


Input Parameters:
    field                     Select fields to fit
    fitspw                    Spectral windows/channels to use for fitting the continuum; default all spectral windows in all channels
    spw                       Select spectral windows and channels from which to subtract a continuum estimate; default: all channels in all spectral windows for which the continuum was estimated
    solint                    Continuum fit timescale (units optional)
    fitorder                  Polynomial order for fit
    mode                      Desired use of fit model (see below)

Example:

ms.fromfits('ngc5921.ms','/aips++/data/demo/NGC5921.fits')
ms.close()
cb.open('ngc5921.ms')  # add MODEL_DATA, CORRECTED_DATA columns
cb.close()
ms.open('ngc5921.ms',nomodify=False);    # writable!
ms.continuumsubold(field=2,fitspw='0:5~9;50~59',solint=0.0,
fitorder=1,mode='subtract')
ms.done()

This example will fit a linear continuum to channels 5-9 and 50-59
in spectral window 0 in each scan-averaged spectrum for field 2,
and store the result in the MODEL_DATA column and subtract it from
the CORRECTED_DATA column.
