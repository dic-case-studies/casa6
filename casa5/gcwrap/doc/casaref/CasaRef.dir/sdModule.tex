\begin{ahmodule}{sd}{Single-dish data analysis package}

\begin{ahdescription}

The sd module provides functions and tools to reduce and analyse 
single-dish data. 
The module can be categorised as 

\begin{itemize}

\item \ahlink{sd}{sd:sd} - Top level tool that contains the following sub 
tools and general functions for single-dish data reduction 
and analysis such as calibration, data averaging, etc. 

\item \ahlink{sd.scantable}{sd:sd.scantable} - Representation of single-dish data 
format. The tool also contains getter/setter functions as well as functions 
that manipulates data contents such as baseline fitting, flagging, etc. 

\item \ahlink{sd.selector}{sd:sd.selector} - Data selector that operates on 
scantable.

\item \ahlink{sd.fitter}{sd:sd.fitter} - This tool is an engine to perform both 
baseline and spectral line fitting.

\item \ahlink{sd.linefinder}{sd:sd.linefinder} - This tool performs automatic 
line finding according to the user specified thresholds.

\item \ahlink{sd.linecatalog}{sd:sd.linecatalog} - Line catalog that contains name of species, 
line frequency with error, and line intensity. 
It accepts both pre-defined line catalog (JPL) for this tool and an user provided 
catalog in ASCII or specific table format.

\item \ahlink{sd.plotter}{sd:sd.plotter} - Plotter tool dedicated for 
single-dish data

%\item \ahlink{interactivemask}{sd:sd.interactivemask} - Tool for GUI based 
%region selection.

\item \ahlink{sd.coordinate}{sd:sd.coordinate} - Tool for conversion from pixel to 
velocity or frequency.

%\item \ahlink{lagflagger}{sd:sd.lagflatter} - 

\item \ahlink{sd.opacity\_model}{sd:sd.opacity_model} - MIRIAD like opacity model.

\item \ahlink{sd.asapgrid}{sd:sd.asapgrid} - Tool to convolve map data onto regularly spaced grid.

\item \ahlink{sd.asaplog}{sd:sd.asaplog} - Wrapper object to allow for both casapy and asap logging.

\end{itemize}
