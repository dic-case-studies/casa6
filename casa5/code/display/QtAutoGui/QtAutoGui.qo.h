// <summary>
// General-purpose Qt options widget created from Record
// </summary>

// <synopsis>
// This class serves the same general purpose as the old glish
// autogui.g: it creates a gui from a record whose fields describe
// 'parameters' (or 'options') to be controlled by the gui.  The record
// used to construct the gui is passed in construction, or soon after,
// via loadRecord().  Each option passed contains an initial value as
// well as meta-data describing the type of input widget to be used
// ('popt' field), labels, limits, choices, help texts, etc., as applicable.
//
// When the user operates the control for a gui option, a setOptions
// signal is emitted with a similar casacore::Record indicating which option was
// changed, and new value.  If the 'Apply' button of the gui is pressed,
// the setOptions signal contains the current value of every option.
// </synopsis>

		//# This is the signal that needs to be sent whenever a value
		//# is changed on the gui, or when 'apply' is pressed.  When
		//# a gui value change occurs, send only that option; when
		//# 'apply' is pressed, send the current value of all options.
		//# The record format should be as for getOptions, although not
		//# all fields are always sent.  You need only send the 'value'
		//# field of the option[s], although you can send the other fields
		//# too if you want.
		//#
		//# Look at the format of setoptions events sent in the current
		//# viewer; this is the format the C++ display library expects.
		//# An easy way to do this is to copy this diagnostic-version
		//# glish file to the directory where you run aips++:
		//#
		//#  /users/dking/testcode/g/viewerdisplaydata.g
		//#
		//# Then run the aips++ viewer normally there.  Each time you
		//# change an 'adjust' panel option or press its 'apply', it will
		//# print the record emitted by the setoptions event.

		//# This slot needs to be implemented to handle changes
		//# requested by the C++ library to current values, allowed data
		//# range('pmin, pmax') and display
		//# label ('listname'), as appropriate, for any existing options.
		//#
		//# It would be useful to allow changes to slider increment
		//# ('presolution'), available choices ('popt') and the default
		//# value as well.  Also, it would be useful to support
		//# (new) boolean subfields 'enabled' and 'visible'.  These
		//# features can be postponed, if necessary, though, and we will not
		//# need to support changes to some of the fields sent in these
		//# records from the library (such as help, editable, dlformat...).
		//#
		//# If you're really ambitious, you could try supporting addition of
		//# new option entries, too.

		//# of what we're trying to do here, although modifygui itself is
