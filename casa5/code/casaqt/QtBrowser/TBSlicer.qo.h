// A TBSlicer has two parts: the bottom part allows the user to chooser which
// dimension is viewed along the two axes, and the top part chooses which
// "slice" along those two axes to view.  When the user changes the slice,
// a signal is emitted; the parent/caller is responsible for connecting and
// processing the signal.

signals:

    // for the two dimensions that are mapped to the X- and Y-axes.  The
    // dimension mapped to the X-axis has the value
	// TBConstants::SLICER_ROW_AXIS in the vector while the dimension mapped
	// to the Y-axis has the value TBConstants::SLICER_COL_AXIS in the vector.
	// For example, if the array was 4x4x4, a slice of [SLICER_ROW_AXIS 1
	// SLICER_COL_AXIS] would mean to display the first dimension along the
	// X-axis and the third dimension along the Y-axis and to use 1 as the
	// index for the second dimension.
