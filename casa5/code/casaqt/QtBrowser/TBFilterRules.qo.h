// A TBFilterRule is a single rule that consists of a field, a Comparator, and
// the rule parameters.  A rule consists of one comparator and at least one
// value.  A rule can be negated (i.e., "not equal"), or applied to any field
// (i.e., any field with a value > 5).

    // being compared against; value2 can only be NULL if
