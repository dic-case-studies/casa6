// <synopsis>
// TBTypes is a widget with a number of different panels.  Each panel has
// a different type of input that correspondings to different data types.
// (For example, when entering a number a text field is used whereas entering
// a complex has two spinners.)  Using the TBTypes::setType() method, the
// different panels are shown or hidden as necessary.  Important: the
// functionality of actually collecting the input is not yet implemented.
