# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the 
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp 
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left 
# blank the following patterns are tested: 
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh *.hxx *.hpp 
# *.h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs *.php *.php3 *.inc *.m *.mm
#
# Specialization: define file patterns for C++ documentation and pages for
# 'Related Pages' section.
