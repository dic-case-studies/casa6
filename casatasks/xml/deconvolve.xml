  <shortdescription>Image-domain deconvolution</shortdescription>

  <description>Task deconvolve executes image-domain deconvolution with options for automasking and restoration. It can be viewed as the minor cycle of the iterative image reconstruction offered by the tclean task. The functionality that it introduces is the ability to just run the deconvolution step alone.

                        example : imagename='try'
                        
                        Input images (* = required):
                        
                        try.psf*        - The point spread function
                        try.residual*   - The observed (or residual) image, such as one
                                          generated by tclean
                        try.model       - An existing model image from a previous run of
                                          tclean or deconvolve
                        try.mask        - A pre-defined mask to be either used directly or 
                                          combined with additional masking options
                        try.pb          - Primary beam model, if required for masking settings
                        
                        Output images:
                        
                        try.model       - A new or updated model image
                        try.residual    - An updated residual image
                        try.image       - A restored image, created only when restoration=True
                        try.mask        - The output mask
                        try.prev.mask   - An intermediate by-product of automasking
                                          (when usemask='auto-multithresh')
                        
                        For multi-term wideband imaging, all relevant images above will
                        have additional .tt0,.tt1, etc suffixes to indicate Taylor terms,
                        plus the following extra input images.
                        try.alpha       - spectral index
                        try.alpha.error - estimate of error on spectral index
                        try.beta        - spectral curvature (if nterms &gt; 2)
                        
                        Tip :  Include a directory name in 'imagename' for all
                               output images to be sent there instead of the
                               current working directory : imagename='mydir/try'
                        
                        Tip :  Restarting a deconvolution run without changing 'imagename'
                               implies continuation from the existing model image on disk.
                               By default, the residual image will be recomputed.
                        
                        Note : All deconvolution runs will by default produce restored images.
                               For a niter=0 run, this will be redundant and can optionally
                               be turned off via the 'restoration=T/F' parameter.
                               
                        Note : All input/output images should be 4D image cubes with axes
                               [ra,dec,pol,chan], as is the default for the task tclean. Any input
                               images without this format must be modified (eg with imregrid,
                               imtrans, image.adddegaxes) in order to be accepted.

                                  startmodel = ['try.model.tt0']  will use a starting model only
                                                       for the zeroth order term.

                                                       for the first order term.

                        This starting model can be of a different image shape and size from
                        what is currently being imaged. If so, an image regrid is first triggered
                        to resample the input image onto the target coordinate system.
                        
                        If the startmodel is supplied, but a copy of of the destination
                        imagename.model already exists, deconvolve will exit with an error.

                        A common usage is to set this parameter equal to a single dish image

                        Negative components in the model image will be included as is.

                        --&gt;  scales=[0,6,20]
                        This set of scale sizes should represent the sizes
                        (diameters in units of number of pixels)
                        of dominant features in the image being reconstructed.

                        The smallest scale size is recommended to be 0 (point source),
                        the second the size of the synthesized beam and the third 3-5
                        times the synthesized beam, etc. For example, if the synthesized
                        beam is 10&quot; FWHM and cell=2&quot;,try scales = [0,5,15].

                        For numerical stability, the largest scale must be
                        smaller than the image (or mask) size and smaller than or
                        comparable to the scale corresponding to the lowest measured
                        spatial frequency (as a scale size much larger than what the
                        instrument is sensitive to is unconstrained by the data making
                        it harder to recovery from errors during the minor cycle).

                        - nterms=1 : Assume flat spectrum source
                        - nterms=2 : Spectrum is a straight line with a slope
                        - nterms=N : A polynomial of order N-1

                        From a Taylor expansion of the expression of a power law, the
                        spectral index is derived as alpha = taylorcoeff_1 / taylorcoeff_0

                        Spectral curvature is similarly derived when possible.

                        The optimal number of Taylor terms depends on the available
                        signal to noise ratio, bandwidth ratio, and spectral shape of the
                        source as seen by the telescope (sky spectrum x PB spectrum).

                        nterms=2 is a good starting point for wideband EVLA imaging
                        and the lower frequency bands of ALMA (when fractional bandwidth
                        is greater than 10%) and if there is at least one bright source for
                        which a dynamic range of greater than few 100 is desired.

                        Spectral artifacts for the VLA often look like spokes radiating out from
                        a bright source (i.e. in the image made with standard mfs imaging).
                        If increasing the number of terms does not eliminate these artifacts,
                        check the data for inadequate bandpass calibration. If the source is away
                        from the pointing center, consider including wide-field corrections too.

                        (Note : In addition to output Taylor coefficient images .tt0,.tt1,etc
                                images of spectral index (.alpha), an estimate of error on
                                spectral index (.alpha.error) and spectral curvature (.beta,
                                if nterms is greater than 2) are produced.
                                - These alpha, alpha.error and beta images contain
                                  internal T/F masks based on a threshold computed
                                  as peakresidual/10. Additional masking based on
                                  .alpha/.alpha.error may be desirable.
                                - .alpha.error is a purely empirical estimate derived
                                  from the propagation of error during the division of
                                  two noisy numbers (alpha = xx.tt1/xx.tt0) where the
                                  'error' on tt1 and tt0 are simply the values picked from
                                  the corresponding residual images. The absolute value
                                  of the error is not always accurate and it is best to interpret
                                  the errors across the image only in a relative sense.)

      <description>A numerical control to bias the scales when using multi-scale or mtmfs algorithms.
                        The peak from each scale's smoothed residual is
                        multiplied by ( 1 - smallscalebias * scale/maxscale )
                        to increase or decrease the amplitude relative to other scales,
                        before the scale with the largest peak is chosen. 
                        Smallscalebias can be varied between -1.0 and 1.0. 
                        A score of 0.0 gives all scales equal weight (default). 
                        A score larger than 0.0 will bias the solution towards smaller scales. 
                        A score smaller than 0.0 will bias the solution towards larger scales.
                        The effect of smallscalebias is more pronounced when using multi-scale relative to mtmfs.

                        The default initial scale sizes used by Asp Clean is [0, w, 2w, 4w, 8w],

                        would be [0, w, ... up to the `largestscale`]. This is only an initial guess,
                        and actual fitted scale sizes may evolve from these initial values.

                        It is recommended not to set `largestscale` unless Asp Clean picks a large

                        A stopping criterion based on total iteration count.
                        Currently the parameter type is defined as an integer therefore the integer value 
                        larger than 2147483647 will not be set properly as it causes an overflow.

                        Iterations are typically defined as the selecting one flux component
                        and partially subtracting it out from the residual image.

                        niter=0 : Skip the deconvolution step (only do restoration)

                        niter larger than zero : The minor cycle.

                        Note :  The following additional triggers will also stop minor cycle
                                iterations. Whichever condition is triggered first stops the minor
                                cycle.
                        
                                'threshold' : The parameter value, compared to peak residual.
                                Divergence :  As detected by an increase of 10% in peak residual from
                                              the minimum so far (during minor cycle iterations).
                                
                                The first criterion to be satisfied takes precedence.

                        Note :  Iteration counts for cubes or multi-field images :
                                For images with multiple planes (or image fields) on which the
                                deconvolver operates in sequence, iterations are counted across
                                all planes (or image fields). The iteration count is compared with
                                'niter' only after all channels/planes/fields have completed their
                                minor cycles and exited either due to 'niter' or 'threshold'.
                                Therefore, the actual number of iterations reported in the logger
                                can sometimes be larger than the user specified value in 'niter'.
                                For example, with niter=100, nchan=10,threshold=0,
                                a total of 1000 iterations will be done in the first set of minor cycles
                                before the total is compared with niter=100 and it exits.

                        be considered for the centers of flux components in the minor cycle.
                        If regions specified fall completely outside of the image, deconvolve will throw an error.

                        Manual mask options/examples :

                        mask='xxx.mask'  : Use this CASA image named xxx.mask and containing
                                           ones and zeros as the mask. 
                                           If the mask is only different in spatial coordinates from what is being made 
                                           it will be resampled to the target coordinate system before being used.
                                           The mask has to have the same shape in velocity and Stokes planes
                                           as the output image. Exceptions are single velocity and/or single
                                           Stokes plane masks. They will be expanded to cover all velocity and/or
                                           Stokes planes of the output cube.
                                           
                                           [ Note : If an error occurs during image resampling or
                                                    if the expected mask does not appear, please try
                                                    using tasks 'imregrid' or 'makemask' to resample
                                                    the mask image onto a CASA image with the target
                                                    shape and coordinates and supply it via the 'mask'
                                                    parameter. ]


                        mask='xxx.crtf' : A text file with region strings and the following on the first line
                                             ( #CRTFv0 CASA Region Text Format version 0 )
                                          This is the format of a file created via the viewer's region
                                          tool when saved in CASA region file format.

                        mask='circle[[40pix,40pix],10pix]'  : A CASA region string.

                        mask=['xxx.mask','xxx.crtf', 'circle[[40pix,40pix],10pix]']  : a list of masks





                        Note : Mask images for deconvolution must contain 1 or 0 in each pixel.
                               Such a mask is different from an internal T/F mask that can be
                               held within each CASA image. These two types of masks are not
                               automatically interchangeable, so please use the makemask task
                               to copy between them if you need to construct a 1/0 based mask
                               from a T/F one.

                        Note : Work is in progress to generate more flexible masking options and
                               enable more controls.
