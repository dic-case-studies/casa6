// GUI for entering a TaQL command.

// <synopsis>
// A TBTaQL widget contains two basic parts: the builder and the command text
// edit.  The builder contains GUI components that allow the user to visually
// put together a TaQL command; once the command is built, the actual comamnd
// can be generated.  The command can also be manually edited.  When the
// command is accepted, a signal is emitted with the command in casacore::String format;
// it is the parent/caller's responsibility to collect the command.
// NOTE: at this time, only the builder for the SELECT command has been
// implemented (and not a very advanced implementation, at that).
// </synopsis>
