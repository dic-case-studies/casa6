/** @Brief SDM UVW engine: compute the uvw these being not present in the SDM but
    required to build casacore::MS main table.
    

    This UvwCoords class is an engine to determine the UVW coordinates at any time for
    any antenna (sub)array. It is based on the casacore::Measure classes in CASA and the ASDM 
    classes. It requires as input the casacore::MS timeCentroids item which is an output in the 
    ASDM DAMs.
    @todo 
    - apply the chain of offsets for the reference point in the antenna to the position 
    of the station
    - correlationMode filter
    @note The current limitations are set by the status of the ASDM. Not supported:
    - phase direction not in J2000
    - OTF due to a limitation in the model of the phase direction item in the field 
    table.
