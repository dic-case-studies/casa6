%\chapter{Appendix IV. - Measurement Sets}
\chapter{Under the Hood: Measurement Sets}
\label{chapter:app.ms}

Visibility data are stored in a CASA table known as a
Measurement Set (MS).  An MS consists of a main table containing the
visibility data and associated sub-tables containing auxiliary or
secondary information.  The most recent specification for the MS
is {\bf Aips++ MeasurementSet definition version 2.0}
(\url{http://aips2.nrao.edu/docs/notes/229/229.html}).
This documentation will eventually be updated to the CASA 
document system.

Table \ref{tabselect} lists data selection
parameters which may be used during a typical data reduction session
while Table \ref{tabmain} identifies the commonly accessed components
of the {\tt MAIN} table in data sets.

Each row in a data column in the MS (e.g. {\tt DATA}, {\tt ALMA\_PHAS\_CORR},
{\tt CORRECTED\_DATA}) contains a matrix of observed complex visibilities at
a single time stamp, for a single baseline in a single spectral
window.  The shape of the data matrix is given by the number of
channels and the number of correlations (voltage-products) formed by
the correlator for an array.  

All CASA data files, including Measurement Sets, are written into
the current working directory by default, with each CASA table
represented as a separate sub-directory.  MS names therefore need only
comply with UNIX file or directory naming conventions, and can be
referred to from within CASA directly, or via full path names.
