These files:

    ds9parse.hh  location.hh  position.hh
    stack.hh     ds9lex.cc    ds9parse.cc

were generated by bison 2.5 and flex 2.5.35 from ds9lex.ll and
ds9parse.yy. The file:

    FlexLexer.h

is part of the flex distribution. The generated files are checked
in here to avoid limitations inherent to the output of older
versions of flex and bison.

All of these files can be removed once CASA's standard development
environment reaches bison/flex 2.5 (i.e. RHEL6). At that point,
display/CMakeLists.txt should be adjusted to begin generating
these files.
