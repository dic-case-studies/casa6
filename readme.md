## CASAtasks

If you are looking for the place to check out [CASA](http://casa.nrao.edu/) with [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), this is not the right place. The repository to check out [CASA](http://casa.nrao.edu/) can be found [here](https://open-bitbucket.nrao.edu/projects/CASA/repos/casa/browse). At some point in the future, this may form the underlying kernel for a future version of [CASA](http://casa.nrao.edu/), but at this point, this package is still in gestation.

CASAtasks is a self-contained python module that provides the tasks from the [CASA](http://casa.nrao.edu/) project. This package depends on the [CASAtools](https://open-bitbucket.nrao.edu/projects/CASA/repos/CASAtools/browse) python module being found in your **PYTHONPATH** at build time and runtime. The CASAtasks are stateless routines and recipes built on CASAtools.
