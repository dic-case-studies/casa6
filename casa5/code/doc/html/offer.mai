Sorry, I lost one simple text file. Here it comes. Rename it to

 Richard,

 About NFRA to provide a design for the AIPS++ Documentation System:
 ------------------------------------------------------------------

 o Why NFRA?

 1) We have always emphasized the importance of good documentation.
 2) We have experience in setting/keeping up such a system (NEWSTAR).
 3) We have manpower available.
 
 
 o What will we do exactly?

 Design a system that will take care of all AIPS++ documentation
 needs:
 
 1) Make an inventory of the access needs and define the properties
    of the various pieces of documentation and their links. Typically:
    - layered along levels of experience (tutorials, reference manuals
      or `bibles', technical descriptions);
    - partitioned according to application domains (frameworks,
      subsystems, modules, or whatever);
    - navigation via hyperlinks (xmosaic viewer).
 
 2) Critically survey the existing AIPS++ documentation:
    - list what can be used for the new system and how it can be
      integrated;
    - list the additional pieces of information needed to expand it to
      a useful system before, say, the end of 1994;
    - make a hotlist of documents quickly needed by the prototypers,
      and try to get them written by someone -- such as the Map/List
      and Table tutorials promised by Olnon.
 
 3) Define how the various pieces of documentation will be generated,
    stored and maintained:
    - To what extent can this automatically be done via the existing
      or slightly adapted code management system?
    - Which responsabilities must be laid where (central and local
      management, integrators, programmmers, users)?
    - Which rules will be enforced and what support should be
      available (in the form of tools, guides, personal assistence)?
 
 
 o When will it be ready?
 
 Before 1994 September 1. How many of the hotlist documents will be
 ready by then depends on the outside-NFRA help we get.
 
 
 o Where do we go from there?
 
 1) Before January 1995, the mechanics of the new documentation system
    must be in place and the first flesh put on the bones, so that the
    beta AIPS++ release contains enough for serious field tests of the
    documentation. It is not yet clear who will do what -- that is
    part of our design and subsequent managerial decisions --, but I
    guess that NFRA will do most of that.
 
 2) By January 1995, the organisation of the documentation system must
    be integrated with that of the rest of the AIPS++ system. From
    then on NFRA will play no special role, unless it is decided
    otherwise.
