Summary:
    Attach the Imagepol tool to a test image file

Description:



This function can be used to generate a test image and then
attach the Imagepol tool to it.

The test image is 4-dimensional (RA, DEC, Stokes and Frequency).  The
Stokes axis holds I,Q,U and V.  The source is just a constant I (if you
don't add noise all spatial pixels will be identical) and V.  Q and U
vary with frequency according to the specified Rotation Measure
components (no attempt to handle bandwidth smearing within channels is
made).  The actual values of I,Q,U, and V are chosen arbitrarily
otherwise (could be added as arguments if desired).

You can use this image, in particular, to explore the Rotation Measure
algorithms in functions rotationmeasure and
fourierrotationmeasure.

If you don't specify the Rotation Measure, then it is chosen for you so
that there is no position angle ambiguity between adjacent channels
(the value will be sent to the Logger).

The noise added to the image is specified as a fraction of the total
intensity (constant).  Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of
{stfaf sigma * $I_{max}$} is then added to the image.

Input Parameters:
    outfile                   Output image file name
    rm                        Rotation Measure (rad/m/m).  Default is auto no-ambiguity determine.

Summary:
    Linear depolarization ratio

Description:



This function  returns the linear
depolarization ratio computed from two frequencies; this is the ratio of
the fractional linear polarization at the two frequencies.  Generally
this is done when you have generated two images, each at a different frequency
(continuum work). Thus if the fractional linear polarization images are
$m_{nu 1}$ and $m_{nu 2}$ then the depolarization ratio is
$m_{nu 1}/ m_{nu 2}$.

This function operates with two images; the first (at frequency $nu 1$)
is the one attached to your Imagepol tool.  The second (at
frequency $nu 2$) is supplied via the argument {stfaf infile}, which
is  a String holding the name of the
imagefile.

In generating the depolarization ratio, you may optionally debias the
linearly polarized intensity.  This requires the standard deviation of
the thermal noise.  You can either supply it if you know it, or it will
be worked out for you with outliers from the mean clipped at the
specified level.

You can get the depolarization ratio error image with function
sigmadepolratio.

Input Parameters:
    infile                    Other image
    debias                    Debias the linearly polarized intensity ?

imagepol tool is ``null'' after this change (it is not destroyed) and
calling any toolfunction other than open will result in an

Summary:
    Find Rotation Measure (Fourier approach)

Description:



This function  will only work if
you attach the Imagepol tool (using open) to an image containing
Stokes Q and U, and a regular frequency axis.  It Fourier transforms
the complex linear polarization (Q+iU) over the spectral axis to the
rotation measure axis.  Thus, if your input image contained
RA/DEC/Stokes/Frequency, the output image would be
RA/DEC/RotationMeasure.  The Rotation Measure axis has as many pixels
as the spectral axis.

This method enables you to see the polarization as a function of
Rotation Meausure.  Its main use is when searching for large RMs.  See
Killeen, Fluke, Zhao and Ekers (1999, preprint) for a description of
this method (or http://www.atnf.csiro.au/verb+~+nkilleen/rm.ps) and its
advantages over the traditional method
(rotationmeasure) of
extracting the Rotation Measure.

Although you can write out the complex polarization image with the
argument {stfaf complex}, you can't do much with it because Image
tools cannot handle complex images.  Hence you can
also write out the complex linear polarization image in any or all of
the other forms.

The argument {stfaf zerolag0} allows you to force the zero lag (or
central bin) of the Rotation Measure spectrum to zero (effectively by
subtracting the mean of Q and U from the Q and U images).  This may
avoid Gibbs phenomena from any strong low Rotation Measure signal which
would normally fall into the central bin.

Input Parameters:
    complex                   Output complex linear polarization image file name.  Default is unset.
    amp                       Output linear polarization amplitude image file name  Default is unset.
    pa                        Output linear polarization position angle (degrees) image file name  Default is unset.
    real                      Output linear polarization real image file name  Default is unset.
    imag                      Output linear polarization imaginary angle image file name  Default is unset.

Summary:
    Linearly polarized intensity

Description:


This application returns the linearly polarized intensity; $sqrt{(Q^2+U^2)}$.

The linearly polarized intensity may optionally be debiased (if debias=True).
This requires an estimate of the thermal noise level (sigma). The resulting
image will be computed using

$sqrt{(Q^2 + U^2 - sigma^2)}$

If the specified value of sigma is positive, that is the value that will
be used for debiasing. If it is not, the value used for sigma is computed
using the following algorithm:

1. First, a stokes plane(s) is chosen on which the sigma computation is performed.
If the V plane exists, that is used to compute sigma. If not, then the value of
sigma is computed to be the average of the sigma values of the Q and U planes.

2. For the relevant plane(s), the sigma value is computed for unmasked pixel values
which lie within +/- (clip * stddev) values of the mean for that plane, where the mean
and stddev (the standard deviation) are computed by using all unmasked pixel values
in the relevant plane. In this way, outliers (eg pixels due to possible
astronomical signals) are excluded in the computation of sigma.

In the output image, pixels for which the expression inside the square root is
negative are masked, and their values are set to zero.

If a region and/or mask is specified, debias=True and sigma is not positive so
that the value of sigma is determined using the algorithm above, the region and mask
are applied first to the plane(s) from which the value of sigma is determined and
then sigma is computed.

Input Parameters:
    debias                    Debias the linearly polarized intensity ?
    clip                      Clip level for auto-sigma determination
    sigma                     Standard deviation of thermal noise.  Default is auto determined.

    region                    Region selection. Default is to use the full image.

Summary:
    Open a new image with this imagepol tool

Description:



Before polarimetric analysis can commence, an imagefile must be
attached to the imagepol tool using the open function.  Also, use this
function when you are finished analyzing the current imagefile and
want to attach to another one.  This function detaches the imagetool
from the current imagefile, if one exists, and reattaches it (opens)
to the new imagefile.

The input image file may be in native casa, fits, or Miriad
format.  Look htmlref{here}{IMAGES:FOREIGNIMAGES}  for more
information on foreign images.

The input image must have a Stokes axis. The exact collection of
Stokes that the image has, determines what the Imagepol tool can
compute. Stokes I, Q, U, and V refer to total intensity, two
components of linear polarization, and circular polatization,
respectively. Therefore, if you ask for linear polarization and the
image only has Stokes I and V, you will get an error.

The input image may contain data at many frequencies. For example, the
image may be a 4D image with axes RA, DEC, Stokes and Frequency (order
not important) where the Frequency axis is regularly sampled. However,
the image may also contain many frequencies at irregular
intervals. Such an image may be created with the Image tool function
imageconcat. It enables you to concatenate images along an axis, and
it allows irregular coordinate values along that axis.

Input Parameters:
    image                     image file name or image record (generated by ia.torecord()) 

Example:


#

Summary:
    Find Rotation Measure (traditional approach)

Description:



This function generates the rotation
measure image from a collection of different frequencies.  It will only
work if the Imagepol tool is attached to an image containing
Stokes $Q$ and $U$, and a frequency axis (regular or irregular) with at
least 2 pixels.  It will work out the position angle images for you.

See also the fourierrotationmeasure
function for a new Fourier-based approach.

Rotation Measure algorithms that work robustly are not common.  The main
problem is in trying to account for the $n- pi$ ambiguity (see Leahy et
al, Astronomy & Astrophysics, 156, 234 or Killeen et al;
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/verb+~+nkilleen/rm.ps).

The algorithm that this function uses is that of Leahy et al. (see Appendix A.1).  But as in all
these algorithms, the basic process is that for each spatial pixel, a
vector of position angles (i.e.  at the different frequencies) is fit to
determine the rotation measure and the position angle at zero wavelength
(and their errors).   An image containing
the number of $n- pi$ turns that were added to the data
at each spatial pixel and for which the best fit was found can be written.
The reduced chi-squared image for the fits can also be written.

Note that no assessment of curvature (i.e. deviation
from the simple linear position angle - $lambda^2$ functional form)
is made.

Any combination of output images can be written.

The argument {stfaf sigma} gives the thermal noise in Stokes Q and U.
By default it is determined automatically using the image data.  But if it proves
to be inaccurate (maybe not many signal-free pixels), it may be specified.
This is used for calculating the error in the
position angles (propagation of Gaussian errors).

The argument {stfaf maxpaerr} specifies the maximum allowable error in
the position angle that is acceptable.  The default is an infinite
value.  From the standard propagation of errors, the error in the
linearly polarized position angle is determined from the Stokes $Q$ and
$U$ images (at each spatial pixel for each frequency).  At each spatial
pixel we do a fit to the position angle vector (i.e.  at the different
frequencies) to determine the rotation measure.  If the position angle
error for any pixel in the vector exceeds the specified value, it is
dropped from the fit.     The process generates an error for the
fit and this is used to compute the errors in the output
images.

Note that {stfaf maxpaerr} is {it not} used to specify that any pixel
for which the output position angle error exceeds this value
should be masked out.

The argument {stfaf rmfg} is used to specify a foreground RM value.  For
example, you may know the mean RM in some direction out of the Galaxy,
then including this can aid the algorithm by reducing ambiguity.

The argument {stfaf rmmax} specifies the maximum absolute RM that
should be solved for.  This quite an important parameter.  If you leave
it at the default, zero, no ambiguity handling will be
used.  So some apriori information should be supplied; this
is the basic problem with rotation measure algorithms.

Input Parameters:
    rm                        Output Rotation Measure image file name. Default is unset.
    rmerr                     Output Rotation Measure error image file name. Default is unset.

    rmmax                     Maximum rotation measure (rad/m/m) to solve for. IMPORTANT TO SPECIFY.
    maxpaerr                  Maximum input position angle error (degrees) to allow
    plotter                   Name of plotter.  Default is none.
    nx                        Number of plots in x direction
    ny                        Number of plots in y direction

Example:


#
print 't----t rotationmeasure Ex 1 t----'
#im = ia.imageconcat(outfile='stokes.image',

ok = po.rotationmeasure(rm='rm', rmerr='rmerr', rmmax=800, maxpaerr=10)
#



Say we have 5 images, each with axes RA, DEC, Stokes, and Frequency in
that order.  We use the Image tool to concatenate these images
along the frequency axis - you have ordered them in increasing or
decreasing frequency order.  We then compute the Rotation Measure
and Rotation Measure error images with the traditional method and
write them out to disk.

Summary:
    Error in linear depolarization ratio

Description:



This function  returns the error
in the linear depolarization ratio computed from two frequencies; this
is the ratio of the fractional linear polarization at the two
frequencies.  Generally this is done when you have generated two
images, each at a different frequency (continuum work). Thus if the
fractional linear polarzation images are $m1$ and $m2$ then the
depolarization ratio is $m1/m2$.

This function operates with two images; the first is attached
to the Imagepol tool.  The second is supplied via the
argument {stfaf infile}, which is  a String
holding the name of the imagefile.

In generating the depolarization ratio, and hence its error, you may

Summary:
    Total polarized intensity

Description:


This application returns the total polarized intensity;

$sqrt{( Q^2+ U^2+ V^2)}$.

If the image contains only Q and U, or only V, then just
those components contribute to the total polarized intensity.

The polarized intensity may optionally be debiased (if debias=True).
This requires an estimate of the thermal noise level (sigma).
The resulting image will be computed using

$sqrt{(Q^2 + U^2 + V^2 - sigma^2)}$

If the specified value of sigma is positive, that is the value that will
be used for debiasing. If it is not, the value used for sigma is computed
using the following algorithm:

1. First, a stokes plane(s) is chosen on which the sigma computation is performed.
If the V plane exists, that is used to compute sigma. If not, then the value of
sigma is computed to be the average of the sigma values of the Q and U planes.

2. For the relevant plane(s), the sigma value is computed for unmasked pixel values
which lie within +/- (clip * stddev) values of the mean for that plane, where the mean
and stddev (the standard deviation) are computed by using all unmasked pixel values
in the relevant plane. In this way, outliers (eg pixels due to possible
astronomical signals) are excluded in the computation of sigma.

In the output image, pixels for which the expression inside the square root is
negative are masked, and their values are set to zero.

If a region and/or mask is specified, debias=True and sigma is not positive so
that the value of sigma is determined using the algorithm above, the region and mask
are applied first to the plane(s) from which the value of sigma is determined and
then sigma is computed.

Input Parameters:
    debias                    Debias the total polarized intensity ?
    clip                      Clip level for auto-sigma determination
    sigma                     Standard deviation of thermal noised.  Default is auto determined.
    outfile                   Output image file name.  Default is unset.
    region                    Region selection. Default is to use the full image.
    mask                      Mask to use. Default setting is none.
    stretch                   Stretch the mask if necessary and possible? Default value is false.

#
print 't----t totpolint Ex 1 t----'
po.open('stokes.image')
tpi = po.totpolint()
tpi.statistics()
tpi.done()
