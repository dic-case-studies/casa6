<A NAME="cxx2html_0"><h2>NAME</h2>cxx2html - C++ to HTML Converter</A>
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_1"><h2>SYNOPSIS</h2></A>
cxx2html is an extractor which pulls HTML-like comments from C++
source code and generates HTML pages describing the classes as
output. One HTML page is generated for each header file. 
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_2"><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2></A>
cxx2html operates in two passes first it scans the header files looking
for important sections, e.g. classes, and then it generates the HTML
pages for each header. The input to cxx2html is a series of flags (each 
preceeded by a <B>-</B>) followed by one or more C++ header files to process. 
<p>This extractor attempts to preserve the relative hierarchy of the header
files in placement the generated HTML file. So if cxx2html were given the
following files:
<p><pre>
        /usr/home/fred/One.h
        /usr/home/fred/Group/Two.h
</pre>
it would generate:
<p><pre>
        One.html
        Group/Two.html
</pre>
to preserve the hierarchy of the header files (this behavior can be turned
off, see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_12">-flat</A>
).
<p>cxx2html uses the information collected during the initial scan of the C++
header files to create the links between classes. The information can either
be temporary and be used only during the single execution (the default), or
it can be persistent (see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_9">-db</A>
).
<p>The output of cxx2html has been tuned for use with Mosaic, but it may work
with other browsers.
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_3"><h2>SWITCHES</h2></A>
cxx2html is invoked as:
<p><pre>
        cxx2html FLAGS FILES
</pre>
where <I>FLAGS</I> is <B>zero</B> or more switches separated by white space, and 
<I>FILES</I> is one or more C++ header files to be converted to HTML
pages. Each switch is preceeded by a "<B>-</B>"; the switches include:
<p>
<dl>

<A NAME=""></A>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_4"><B> --</B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
indicates that no more switches follow. The remaining parameters are
considered filenames. Note that this is <B>not</B> usually required; it is
only required when dealing with oddly named files.
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_5"> <B>-aips</B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
this flag is used to turn <B>off</B> the <FONT FACE=helvetica>AIPS++</FONT> specific tags 
(see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_28"><FONT FACE=helvetica>AIPS++</FONT> TAGS</A>
). It also does not require that a summary line is given.
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_5a"><B> -maxsumlen <I>N</I></B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
defines the maximum length of a summary line (default is 80).
A value of 0 indicates an infinite length.
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_6"><B> -clear</B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
indicates that the database (see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_9">-db</A>
) should be cleared and regenerated.
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_7"><B> -copy</A>  <I>file</I></B></dt>
<dd>
this is intended to allow inclusion of copyright information at the end of
generated files. <I>file</I> should be a fully qualified path which is marked
up with HTML. If this file exists and is readable, it will be included at
the end of each of the generated pages. "<B>-copyright</B>" is a synonym.
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_8"><B> -create</B></A> </dt>
<dd>
indicates that cxx2html should attempt to create any directories which it
needs. This switch should be used with <B>caution</B>.
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_9"><B> -db</A>  <I>name</I></B> </dt>
<dd>
specifies that <I>name</I> should be the name for a DBM style database to
store information about the contents of the header files.
<p></dd>
<p>
Normally, no external database is created, but rather all of the information
is stored internally, and lost after cxx2html exits.
<p>If the scan switch (see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_15">-scan</A>
) is given, the information about the header
files (given on the command line) will be added to this database. <B>No</B> other
action will be taken.
<p>If the scan switch is not given, this database will be consulted for 
header file information. All of the header files will be rescanned
only when a header file which has not previously been scanned is
encountered.
<p>Note that if a header file is modified after it has been scanned into
the database then its database entries will probably be invalid.
<p><dt><A NAME="cxx2html_10"><B> -dir</A>  <I>directory</I></B> </dt>
<dd>
indicates that the output files should be placed in <I>directory</I>.
"<B>-directory</B>" is a synonym.
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_11"><B> -ext</A>  <I>extension</I></B> </dt>
<dd>
This can be used to specify an alternate extension for the output files.
By default, all the output files are produced with an <B>html</B> extension.
This flag could be used like:
<p></dd>
<p>
<pre>
        cxx2html -ext htm *.h
</pre>
to cause all of the output files to be generated with an <B>htm</B> extension
instead. "<B>-extension</B>" is a synonym.
<p><dt><A NAME="cxx2html_12"><B> -flat</A> </B> </dt>
<dd>
indicates that the directory hierarchy of the input header files should not
be preserved, and the HTML files should just be dumped into the current
directory or a specified directory (see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_10">-dir</A>
).
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_13"><B> -rel</A> </B> </dt>
<dd>
indicates that relative paths should be used within the generated HTML
files to access <B>non-generated</B> files, e.g. the input header files.
By default, absolute paths are used to access the files which are <B>not</B>
generated by cxx2html. Relative paths are <B>always</B> used to access files
generated by cxx2html. "<B>-relative</B>" is a synonym.
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_14"><B> -root</A>  <I>directory</I></B> </dt>
<dd>
indicates that <I>directory</I> should be considered a root of the header
files. To preserve the directory hierarchy of the input header files, the
roots of the header files must be known. Once the roots are available, the 
directory hierarchy is preserved based on these roots. If no roots, are
supplied then the minimal hierarchy (the maximum root) is calculated based
on the header files supplied as parameters. Multiple 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_14">-root</A>
 flags can
be used to specify more than one possible root. 
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_15"><B> -scan</A> </B> </dt>
<dd>
indicates that cxx2html should <B>not</B> generate any HTML files, but only
scan the files and generate the dictionary of information. A database
must be specified for this flag to be used (see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_9">-db</A>
).
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_16"><B> -v</A> </B> </dt>
<dd>
print out the version information.
<p></dd>
<p>

</dl>


<A NAME="cxx2html_17"><h2>COMMENT LANGUAGE</h2></A>
The following assumptions are made about the C++ header files which
are being documented:
<p><pre>
         (1)  Documentation immediately precedes the language element
         (2)  All of the header files being documented have unique names
         (3)  All of the classes being documented have unique names
         (4)  All comments are written using C++ style comments
</pre>
So, a class might look like:
<p><pre>
        // This is the &lt;b&gt;good&lt;/b&gt; documentation for foo
        class foo {
            foo(); // ctor (THIS WILL BE ATTACHED TO "~foo()"!)
            ~foo();
        };
</pre>
These rules apply to function documentation as well. Thus, adding a comment
to the end of a function declaration means that it will be associated with
the next language element (as with the destructor above). 
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_18"><h2>HTML</h2></A>
In general, the class comments are marked up with HTML. This markup is
transported verbatim to the output HTML pages. Empty comment lines are
interpreted as paragraph breaks.
<p>There are a number of extensions which may be useful. These were added
to identify sections which were important for code documentation or
to simplify the task of generating documentation for source code.
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_19"><h2>LINKTO </h2></A>
Because the extractor knows about all of the classes and where they
are located in the generated HTML pages, there is a extractor expanded
tag which indicates that a link to a particular class (which the
cxx2html should have seen) should be created. This tag is:
<p><pre>
        &lt;linkto class=TableKeywords&gt;good class!&lt;/linkto&gt;
</pre>
When cxx2html finds a tag of this form, it substitutes an HTML anchor
which has a hypertext link to the particular section of the HTML page
which discusses the referenced class (here TableKeywords). In this
case, the generated link might look like:
<p><pre>
        &lt;a href="Tables/TableKeywords.html#TableKeywords">good class!&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
The reason this additional tag was useful is because the relative
location the HTML page which documents a class could easily change.
<p>Sometimes it is also necessary to reference URLs within the HTML file
which discusses a given class. This can be done as follows:
<p><pre>
        &lt;linkto class="CLASSNAME#ANCHOR">
</pre>
This will create a link to <I>ANCHOR</I> within the HTML file created for
the class <I>CLASSNAME</I>. The whole anchor must be specified. Another common
case is creating a link to one of the anchors created by cxx2html itself.
This is handled as follows:
<p><pre>
        &lt;linkto class="CLASSNAME:ANCHOR">
</pre>
In this case, a link will be created to the specified anchor which was
created by cxx2html. This link will point to an anchor within the
generated class documentation which looks like:
<p><pre>
        &lt;a name="CLASSNAME:ANCHOR">
</pre>
So, if we wanted to reference the generated description anchor for
TableKeywords, we would insert a tag which looks like:
<p><pre>
        &lt;linkto class="TableKeywords:description">here&lt;/linkto&gt;
</pre>
Links can also be created for function groups 
(see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_26">GLOBAL FUNCTION GROUPS</A>
) as well as classes. This is done as
follows: 
<p><pre>
        &lt;linkto group="MaskArrMath.h#math">here&lt;/linkto&gt;
</pre>
The header file (here <I>MaskArrMath.h</I>) must be specified as well as the
function group name (here <I>math</I>). This is necessary because the function
group names are only assumed to be unique within the header file.
<p>The generated anchors for function groups can be accessed in a way
similar to classes:
<p><pre>
        &lt;linkto group="MaskArrMath.h#math:description">here&lt;/linkto&gt;
</pre>
This would access the description for the <I>math</I> function group. A
similar method works for accessing general anchors in the generated
HTML file for <I>math</I>:
<p><pre>
        &lt;linkto group="MaskArrMath.h#math#my_anchor">here&lt;/linkto&gt;
</pre>
This will create a link to the anchor named <I>my_anchor</I> in the
generated HTML file for <I>math</I>. Another method which is easier,
however, is to use the <B>file</B> attribute:
<p><pre>
        &lt;linkto file="MaskArrMath.h#my_anchor">
</pre>
This will create a link to the anchor <I>my_anchor</I> in the HTML file
generated from the header file <I>MaskArrMath.h</I>. The anchor must be
fully specified. This <I>file</I> attribute could also be used to access
class anchors, but the use of the <I>class</I> attribute is much more
general.
<p>One final attribute which &lt;linkto&gt; can have is <B>module</B>. This attribute
allows the documentation writer to create links to the module HTML
files as well as user defined anchors within the module
documentation. For example:
<p><pre>
        &lt;linkto module=Tables&gt;
        &lt;linkto module="Tables#my_anchor">
</pre>
The first version would just create a link to the HTML file which
documents the <I>Tables</I> module. The second would create a link to the
user specified anchor (<I>my_anchor</I>) within that HTML file. This is
analogous to syntax for the <I>class</I> attribute. Note that there are
<B>no</B> anchors automatically generated by cxx2html for module HTML
files.
<p>Note that in each of these cases only one of the attributes can be
used at a time, either <I>group</I> <B>or</B> <I>class</I> <B>or</B> <I>file</I> <B>or</B>
<I>module</I>. Also, quotes are required for the attribute values in most
of these cases.
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_20"><h2>LINKFROM</h2></A>
This tag is used to indicate that several classes or modules are related
to the current class, module, or global function group. This tag is used
as follows:
<p><pre>
        // &lt;linkfrom anchor=math classes="MaskedArray ROMaskedArray">
        //     Related &lt;here&gt;mathematical functions&lt;/here&gt; for MaskedArrays
        // &lt;/linkfrom&gt;
</pre>
This indicates that links should be created from the <I>MaskedArray</I> and 
<I>ROMaskedArray</I> classes to the anchor <I>math</I> in the HTML file generated
for the current header file. The text contained between the opening and
closing <I>linkfrom</I> tags is used as the label of the link from the listed
classes to the indicated anchor (here <I>math</I>). If this text contains an
opening (&lt;here&gt;) and closing (&lt;/here&gt;) tags, these tags will be replaced
with the HTML anchors which create the requested link.
<p>To create links in a set of modules, the <I>modules</I> attribute is use
instead of (or in addition to) the <I>classes</I> attribute:
<p><pre>
        // &lt;linkfrom anchor=column_ops modules="Tables">
        //     Related &lt;here&gt;column operations&lt;/here&gt; for Tables
        // &lt;/linkfrom&gt;
</pre>
This tag is the inverse of the &lt;linkto&gt; tag (see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_19">LINKTO </A>
). The
&lt;linkto&gt; tag specifies links from the current file to other files, and
&lt;linkfrom&gt; specifies links from other files to the current file.
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_21"><h2>SRCBLOCK </h2></A>
This is a special tag for including code block in the documentation.
Having a unique tag for this ensures that all of the code examples look
the same. Also, the following replacements are made:
<p><pre>
        (1)   &lt; replaced by &amp;lt;
        (2)   &gt; replaced by &amp;gt;
        (3)   " replaced by &amp;quot;
        (4)   &amp; replaced by &amp;amp;
</pre>
In addition, cxx2html will attempt to add the proper amount of
white space in front of the code block to set it off if the author hasn't
already done this, i.e. if there is a line in the code snippet which
begins with less than two space characters, then the whole code block
will be moved over a uniform amount. This tag is used 
as follows:
<p><pre>
        //&lt;srcblock&gt;
        // x() = sqrt(3);
        //&lt;/srcblock&gt;
        double &amp;x();
</pre>
In this case, since the code line has only one leading space character
extra indentation will be added. In the following, however:
<p><pre>
        //&lt;srcblock&gt;
        //   y() = exp(3);
        //&lt;/srcblock&gt;
        double &amp;y();
</pre>
no extra indentation will be added because all of the lines (the
single line) has more than one leading space.
<p>If tabs are used for indentation in a code example, cxx2html will not
attempt to provide extra indentation.
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_22"><h2>SRC</h2></A>
This does the same substitutions, e.g. '&amp;gt;' for '&gt;', as &lt;srcblock&gt;
(see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_21">SRCBLOCK </A>
), but this tag does not separate the text as a block. In
other words, &lt;src&gt; can be use in-line to indicate very short code snippets.
If a code example extends over multiple lines, &lt;srcblock&gt; should be used
instead.
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_23"><h2>SUMMARY</h2></A>
Another tag which is treated specially is the summary tag. This tag
gives a brief one-line summary of the class. It is specified like:
<p><pre>
        &lt;summary&gt; A really good class &lt;/summary&gt;
</pre>
The summary lines are extracted and used whenever the class is used in a
list. This allows the person reading the class documentation to more
easily select classes of interest.
<br>Its length should not exceed the
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_5a">maximum length</A>.
<br>A summary should be given only once per class, etc..
<br>For aips++ the summary is mandatory for each class, global function
group, global enum, and module.
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_24"><h2>MODULES</h2></A>
Often it is useful to break a large set of header files up into
"modules". cxx2html supports a concept of modules. cxx2html makes the
following assumptions about "modules":
<p><pre>
        (1)  Modules are composed of the header files within a particular
             directory.
        (2)  There is a header file with the same basename as the directory,
             so there would be "Tables.h" which would document the module
             composed of "Tables/*.h".
        (3)  The documentation for the module is specified in MODULENAME.h,
             e.g. Tables.h, and is enclosed in:
                           &lt;module&gt; ... &lt;/module&gt;
</pre>
If these conditions hold, then the module documentation in
<I>MODULENAME</I>.h between the &lt;module&gt; tags is extracted, and put into
<I>MODULENAME</I>.html and links to all of the classes in the module are also
added to this HTML file.
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_25"><h2>ELEMENT GROUPS</h2></A>
Often it is useful to apply the same comment to several functions. For
this, there is a cxx2html "group" directive. This is specified like:
<p><pre>
        // Common comment
        // &lt;group&gt;
        func1();
        func2();
        // &lt;/group&gt;
</pre>
This is used within a class, and it specifies that the common documentation
should be applied to each of the elements in the group. These group commands
can be nested. The &lt;group&gt; tag has one attribute <I>name</I>. The name attribute
can be used to associate a HTML anchor with the group:
<p><pre>
        // Common comment
        // &lt;group name=transcendental&gt;
        sin(double x);
        cos(double x);
        // &lt;/group&gt;
</pre>
This indicates that these two functions should be grouped together and that
the group should have the anchor <I>transcendental</I> (in addition to the 
normal anchors created for the individual functions by cxx2html).
<p>A group tag <B>without</B> a <I>name</I> attribute can <B>only</B> be used in
comments within a group which has a <I>name</I> attribute, e.g. a global 
function group (see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_26">GLOBAL FUNCTION GROUPS</A>
), or in comments within
an extracted C++ language element, e.g. a class.
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_26"><h2>GLOBAL FUNCTION GROUPS</h2></A>
Often large groups of global functions are related in some way. These groups
of global functions can be treated much like a class and documented with 
cxx2html.
<p>Here is an example of how global functions can be documented:
<p><pre>
        // &lt;summary&gt; Element by element mathematical operations. &lt;/summary&gt;
        //
        // These functions perform element by element mathematical 
        // operations on masked arrays.
        //
        // &lt;group name=assignment&gt;
        template&lt;class T&gt;
        const MaskedArray&lt;T&gt; &amp; operator+= (const MaskedArray&lt;T&gt; &amp;left,
                                           const Array&lt;T&gt; &amp;other);
        template&lt;class T&gt;
        const MaskedArray&lt;T&gt; &amp; operator-= (const MaskedArray&lt;T&gt; &amp;left,
                                           const Array&lt;T&gt; &amp;other);
        // &lt;/group&gt;
</pre>
This indicates that these two global functions are to be treated as
a group, and extracted by cxx2html. The syntax for introducing a
global function group is the same as element grouping within a class:
<p><pre>
        // &lt;group name=NAME&gt;
</pre>
The <I>NAME </I> is used to generate a anchor within the final HTML page
for this global function group. This <I>NAME </I> must be unique within the
file, i.e. no other classes or function groups can have the same name.
Global function groups <B>must</B> have the <I>name</I> attribute specified, and
while there can be nested <I>group</I> tags, only the outer most <I>group</I> is
treated as a function group.
<p>As with classes, the &lt;summary&gt; has a special meaning for function
groups. It is used in the menu at the top of a file which contains
several function groups or classes.
<p>
<A NAME="cxx2html_26a"><h2>GLOBAL ENUMS</h2></A>
A global <code>enum</code> (i.e. an <code>enum</code> not given in a class)
is also recognized as an entity similar to a class or global function group.
It can be documented in a similar way, e.g.:
<pre>
  // &lt;summary&gt;
  // Enum defining Array storage policies
  // &lt;/summary&gt;
  // StorageInitPolicy is used in functions where an array is formed from
  // a shape and an ordinary pointer. This enum should be in Array but that
  // causes CFront to be unhappy.
  enum StorageInitPolicy {
    // COPY is used when an internal copy of the storage is to be made.
    // The array is NOT responsible for deleting the external storage.
    COPY,
    // TAKE_OVER is used to indicate that the Array should just use the
    // external storage (i.e., no copy is made). The Array class is now
    // responsible for deleting the storage (hence it must have come from
    // a call to new[]).
    TAKE_OVER,
    // Share means that the Array will just use the pointer (no copy), however
    // the Array will NOT delete it upon destruction.
    SHARE
  };
</pre>

<p><h2>HTML-3.0 LIKE EXTENSIONS </h2>
The HTML 3.0 &lt;note&gt; tag  is supported in a primitive form:
<p><pre>
        &lt;note role=tip&gt; this is a tip for the user &lt;/note&gt;
        &lt;note role=caution&gt; this cautions the user &lt;/note&gt;
        &lt;note role=warning&gt; this warns the user of danger &lt;/note&gt;
</pre>
Each of these generates an accented block of text with an appropriate
graphic for the importance of the note. Later when HTML 3.0 is widely
available this support will be removed, and the underlying HTML 3.0
browsers will be relied upon.

<A NAME="cxx2html_28"><FONT FACE=helvetica>AIPS++ TAGS</FONT></A>
The following tags are specific to the documentation standards which
we have developed for the <FONT FACE=helvetica>AIPS++</FONT> project. In general, these tags just
get expanded to be section headers (&lt;h3&gt;).
<p>If the aips flag (see 
<A HREF="cxx2html.html#cxx2html_5">-aips</A>
) is specified, these tags will <B>not</B> be
processed.
<p>Here are the tags:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_29"><B> etymology</B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
This explains why the particular name for the class was
selected. Sometimes this will aid in understanding the class. This is
used as follows:
<p></dd>
<p>
<pre>
        &lt;etymology&gt;
            IPosition is a contraction of "Integral Position".
        &lt;/etymology&gt;
</pre>
<dt><B><A NAME="cxx2html_30"> motivation</A> </B> </dt>
<dd>
This describes the author's motivation for writing the class. It
should detail what conditions necessitated the development of a new
class. Like &lt;synopsis&gt; any tags or text can be included between the
opening and closing &lt;motivation&gt; tags.
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_31"><B> prerequisite</B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
This tag identifies the prerequisite classes which should be understood
before attempting to learn about the new class. This is used like:
<p></dd>
<p>
<pre>
        &lt;prerequisite&gt;
            &lt;li&gt; ClassX
        &lt;/prerequisite&gt;
</pre>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_32"><B> reviewed</B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
This tag is used to indicate the review status of the class. It has
four attributes:
<p></dd>
<p>
<pre>
        reviewer    Who reviewed the class?
        date        When was it reviewed?
        tests       Which test program(s) test this particular class?
        demos       Which demo program(s) show how to uses this class?
</pre>
So this tag is used like:
<p><pre>
        &lt;reviewed reviewer="Doe" date="21Oct94" tests="t2 t3" demos="d1">
              Any necessary verbiage...
        &lt;/reviewed&gt;
</pre>
The text between the opening and closing tags provides a place for any
reviewer comments.
<p><dt><A NAME="cxx2html_33"><B> synopsis</B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
This is used to provide a medium to long description of the class. Any
important text can be included between the opening, &lt;synopsis&gt; and
the closing, &lt;/synopsis&gt;, tags. This text can include any special
purpose tags discussed above or regular HTML tags.
<p></dd>
<p>
<dt><A NAME="cxx2html_34"><B> templating</B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
This is used to identify requirements for the <B>type</B> arguments to a
templated class or function. It essentially identifies the requirements 
imposed upon classes by the template. Its form is:
<p></dd>
<p>
<pre>
        &lt;templating arg=T&gt;
            &lt;li&gt; copy constructor
            &lt;li&gt; assignment operator
        &lt;/templating&gt;
</pre>
This tag has only one attribute, <I>arg</I>. This attribute identifies
which template argument is being discussed.
<p><dt><A NAME="cxx2html_35"><B> thrown</B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
This provides a list of the exceptions which are thrown by a particular
function. This tag is used as follows:
<p></dd>
<p>
<pre>
        &lt;thrown&gt;
            &lt;li&gt; AipsError
            &lt;li&gt; StringError
        &lt;/thrown&gt;
</pre>
This is often useful information when trying to against exceptions.
<p><dt><A NAME="cxx2html_36"><B> todo</B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
This provides a list of improvements, bug fixes, extensions,
etc. which should be added to this class in the future. This is used
like:
<p></dd>
<p>
<pre>
        &lt;todo asof='10Oct94'&gt;
            &lt;li&gt; fix that bug that Tim found
        &lt;/todo&gt;
</pre>
This allows the maintainers of the class to keep a list of all of the
outstanding issues for the class.
<p><dt><A NAME="cxx2html_37"><B> use</B> </A> </dt>
<dd>
This tag indicates the intended use for the class. It currently has
only one attribute, <I>visibility</I>. This attribute has two values, and
is used as follows:
<p></dd>
<p>
<pre>
        &lt;use visibility=export&gt;
        &lt;use visibility=local&gt;
</pre>
The first indicates that the current class is intended to be used by
anyone using the module. The second indicates that the class is only
intended for use within the module; not for use outside the module.
<p>This tag can also be used in global function groups. Other attributes
may be added in the future.
