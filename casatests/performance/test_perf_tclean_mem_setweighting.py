    Background info for this performance test:
    
    As per CAS-12166, memory overuse would be proportional to image_size X number_fiels X number_MSs.
    The script runs a tclean command, in cube mode, as it would be run by the pipeilne in the hif_findcont stage.
    This is the first stage where the memory issue of CAS-12166 etc. tickets would manifest and make CASA crash even
    in large memory machines (256 GB).
    
    Dataset:
    
    The Pillars dataset is one very practical example to expose one type of memory overuse (and leak) issue of 
    CASA 5.4 (and 5.5) that showed up while running the ALMA pipeline in Cycle 6. The major memory issue in 
    cycle 6 affected the setWeighting step of tclean, and became a serious burden in operations, together with 
    other memory issues. The Pillars dataset is small (~2.2 GB for the target MS) but is a mosaic with many fields. 
    The number of fields is the important parameter to expose the setWeighting memory issue.
    
    Example of a casa.synthesis.imager.memprofile.... file:

    Criteria for success and failure
    
    Compare the MemRSS_(VmRSS)_MB values taken by steps [Set Weighting] and [End SynthesisNormalizer].
    The tolerances used for comparison are:

    |  Maximum 300 MB of memory at Set Weighting step.
    |  Maximum 500 MB of memory at last step, End SynthesisNormalizer (more than this would indicate memory leaks)
    |  Maximum of 1.5 GB of memory used in whole tclean run.
