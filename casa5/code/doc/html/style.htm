<H2>Purpose</H2> 

<P>This note supplements the <A HREF="design.html">AIPS++ Information
System Design</A> with suggestions for HTML style in our hand-written
documents. I am still treating it as a "note to myself" as the
prospective editor of astronomical HTML in AIPS++, so I am tossing ideas
into it as I have them. It will evolve into a more homogeneous document
later if others feel that the guidelines are useful. Comments to
<EM>abridle@nrao.edu</EM>
are welcome.
</P> 
<HR>

<H2>Goals for AIPS++ HTML</H2> 

<P>We aim to make the handwritten HTML
</P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#portability">Portable</A>
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="#goodhabits">Readable</A>
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="#printability">Printable</A>
</LI>

</LI>   
</UL>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="portability">Portability: </A>standardize the
language, not the browser!</H3> 

<P>AIPS++ HTML should comply with the standard that is current at the
time of writing. Our aim is to write HTML that displays well across the
space of all compliant browsers, not to optimize for just one of them.
<EM>Never</EM> bend the HTML rules to make prettier output in one
browser. Avoid browser-specific markup, such as the Netscape-specific
HTML <A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/home/services_docs/html-extensions.html">
 "extensions"</A>.
</P>

<P>In-line images are appropriate for technical graphics, but
should be used sparingly or not at all as anchors and headers. Some
users may read documents with text-only browsers such as <CITE>lynx</CITE>,
or with image loading turned off for speed. Although AIPS++ sites should
have local copies of all documents, not all browsing will be done over
high-speed connections. Many sites have users who connect to them via
modem when working from their homes. While we won't design the whole
documentation system around such users, we should not put obstacles in
their way needlessly. I therefore suggest these guidelines for using
images in our HTML:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>There must be a text version of any hypertext anchor. 
</LI>
<LI>When images are used, we should provide replacement (alternative)
text via the ALT="text" tag. (The bland default "[Image]" is assigned if
we don't.) Not all browsers recognize the ALT tag, but many do.  
</LI>
<LI>Ask if an an image adds content in proportion to its bit-size, and
include it only when the answer is clearly "yes". 
</LI> 
</UL>

<P>To use fonts consistently for emphasis, adopt the logical &lt;EM&gt;
tag for <EM>light</EM> emphasis and the &lt;STRONG&gt; tag for strong
emphasis rather than physical italic &lt;I&gt; or bold &lt;B&gt; tags.
There are several reasons for this. Any given user or browser may prefer
a different convention than ours. Some may not like or even have bold or
italic versions of their favorite "normal" font. The logical tags leave
such choices to the reader (following the basic philosophy of HTML).
They are also easier to remember consistently when writing a document!
</P>

<P>Logical markup is also preferred when fonts are used to indicate
function, such as <CITE>citations</CITE> (use &lt;CITE&gt;), <CODE>code
examples</CODE> (use &lt;CODE&gt;), variable names (use &lt;VAR&gt;), 
user inputs (use &lt;KBD&gt;).  
</P> 

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="goodhabits">Readability:</A> general good habits</H3>
 
<H4>Up Front</H4> 

<P>The first few lines should state the document's purpose clearly. The
longer the document, the more important this is. Readers must be able to
decide quickly whether the document is likely to be what they were
looking for.
</P>

<H4>Headings</H4> 

<P>It should be possible to generate a contents list automatically by
scanning the heading tags. We may want to use software to do this on
long hand-written files. Heading tags (&lt;H1&gt;, &lt;H2&gt;, &lt;H3&gt;,
&lt;H4&gt;, etc.) should therefore be nested in order within a document,
and should be used consistently without skipping levels. </P>

<P>&lt;H1&gt;
should be reserved for the first (banner) line in the body of the
document. It's always a large font that takes a lot of space.
</P>

<P>&lt;H2&gt;, &lt;H3&gt;, &lt;H4&gt; are better for Section,
Subsection and Item headings. A document that has many instances of
these headings should also have a menu of internal links to each
heading. This menu should be placed immediately below the initial
statement of purpose, so it works like an active "table of contents" for
the document.
</P>

<P>&lt;H5&gt; and &lt;H6&gt; are too small as rendered by most
browsers to be useful as headings and should probably be avoided.
</P>

<P>Never use headings just to change fonts (e.g. to "bold or "very
small") or to produce white space.
</P>

<H4>Anchors</H4> 

<P>Anchor text should be as meaningful as possible. When readers scan
hypertext on-screen, they tend to see the anchors first because they are
high-lit. When <EM>literally</EM> browsing, they may only see the
anchors. Anchor text should therefore give a sense of what is being
linked to, rather than being just a quilt of "here" notations in regular
text. Anchors are used, among other things, to:
</P>
<DL>
<DT><EM>link to another document:</EM>
</DT>
<DD>the anchor text should be a printable reference to the other
document;  
</DD>
<DT><EM>navigate within a document:</EM>
</DT>
<DD>the anchor text should identify the section being linked to, either
by its heading title or by its position relative to the current section
(next, previous, start of document);  
</DD>
<DT><EM>define or explain a term:</EM>
</DT>
<DD>the anchor text should be the term being defined or explained, e.g.<BR>

<SAMP>The &lt;A HREF="glossary/dirtybeam.html">dirty beam&lt;/A><BR>is
the transform of the sampling function.
</SAMP><BR>The anchor should appear either at the <EM>first</EM>
instance of the term within a document, or at <EM>every</EM> instance. 
  
</DD>
<DT><EM>add depth:</EM>
</DT>
<DD>the anchor text should generally be a parenthetical reference, e.g.

<BR>
<SAMP>(see &lt;A HREF="...">Cornwell 1988&lt;/A>)
</SAMP>
<BR>if the link is to a "references" section of the same document, or<BR>

<SAMP>(see the documentation on &lt;A HREF="...">CLEAN&lt;/A>)
</SAMP><BR>if the link is to another document dealing with "CLEAN".
</DD>   
<DT><EM>go off at a tangent:</EM>
</DT>
<DD>the anchor text should prepare the reader for a tangential leap.
Some may think tangential links improper and to be avoided. But
hypertext should cater to users who are not following the author's plan:
the author's tangent may turn into the user's main highway!  
</DD> 
</DL>

<P>No other markup should ever appear <EM>inside</EM> anchor
tags. For example, a heading may contain an anchor, but there should
never be heading markup within an anchor.
</P>

<H4>Dividers: rules, pagination</H4> 
<P>Use horizontal rules (HTML &lt;HR&gt;) to separate major sections
(topics) in long documents. They add structure and are specially helpful
when the document is printed. If we use html2ps to print documents, it
is helpful to add &lt;!--NewPage--&gt; comments after major sections to
force page breaks. </P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="printability">Printability: </A>avoid mouse traps</H3> 

<P>The many advantages of hypertext and browser-based documents do not
eliminate the need for printed manuals. Not all users prefer to navigate
the multi-linear structures of hypertext. Some are more comfortable with
the logical sequencing implicit in a printed manual. Also, even in the
era of laptop computers, not all browsing of documentation is done at a
computer. We must expect to produce printed manuals from much of the
AIPS++ hypertext documentation. </P>

<P>Our hypertext documentation <EM>style</EM>
must still make sense when the text is printed. This is not difficult if
meaningful linking words (anchor text) are used wherever possible.
Specifically, avoid "here" as an anchor if the document will be printed
(it is sometimes appropriate in documents that will only be seen
on-screen.) Mousey constructions such as "click here" should be avoided
everywhere, as they are not even meaningful to all browsers (there's
nothing to "click" when using <EM>lynx</EM>!)
</P>

<P>People who read printed documents today may want to find them, or
some files that they refer to, in the on-line system tomorrow. It is
therefore useful if the longer HTML files show their own master URL
(i.e., that on <KBD>aips2.nrao.edu</KBD>), and those of major
references that they make, when printed. Displayed URL's are one more
thing to keep track of whenever files are moved within the system, but
this connection between the hyspertext system and the printed format
will be useful.  </P>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="navigability">Navigability: </A>trees or webs?</H3>
 
<P>This is a tricky area that Friso and I are still discussing. The
longer documents in the tutorial parts of our system may benefit from
having tree-like link structures and large granularity to help us print
manuals from them. The maze of small-grained information in the
reference material will almost certainly have to have a web-like link
structure and may therefore need built-in navigation tools. There is a
design tension between the discipline of trees and the adaptability of
webs. Also between the printability of documents as "manuals" and full
use of hypertext as a web. We may need tools that let us collate a large
collection of files in a web for some purposes and separate them for
others. The impact on our style may not be clear until we have explored
more possibilities in this area.
</P>
<H4>Granularity</H4> 
<P>Any body of information larger than a typical browser page can be
organized in two styles, both of which have advantages and
disadvantages:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Large-grained style: keeps the information in one flat file, with a
contents menu that uses internal (name) anchors to point to the sections
of a single document; 
</LI>
<LI>Small-grained style: makes each browser page a file in a "cluster",
using external anchors (within the cluster) to jump between them. The
organizing menu is itself a separate file, in the same directory as or
one level above the cluster. 
</LI> 
</OL><P>In favor of multiple files in a cluster:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Retrieval times (and memory usage) can be much less for snippets of
information; 
</LI>
<LI>Users are not scared by the size of the document, they only see the
parts they think they need; 
</LI>
<LI>Subsections can be checked out and worked on simultaneously by
different documentors. 
</LI> 
</UL><P>In favor of a single file with named anchors:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Users can follow the structure using a scrollbar or 
<KBD>PgUp/PgDn</KBD>, so it is harder to become lost; 
</LI>
<LI>Internal links are easier to maintain and verify (especially where
relative external links are used under a checkin system as in AIPS++:
one can only verify all links explicitly before checkin if the whole
cluster is checked out, or if only one file is checked out); 
</LI>
<LI>It easier to leave a document via the browser's <KBD>back</KBD>
command; the browser's history path is clearer so users are less likely
to become confused about which level of documentation they are reading;

</LI>
<LI>It is easier to print the whole document when needed. 
</LI> 
</UL><P>There is no simple, general way to resolve these trade-offs.
Documentors must decide which is the better approach for a particular
block of information, and provide appropriate navigational aids
whichever style is used. </P>
<H4>Navigation aids</H4> 
<P>Text menus are useful at both ends of a long document, but
obligatory at the start. They can be based on a definition list (&lt;DL>)
with &lt;DT> fields as anchors and &lt;DD> as optional explanations, or
on
&lt;UL> or &lt;OL> lists. List-based menus are most readable when the
anchors are at the front of, or early in, each list item &lt;LI>. The
end of a long document may offer links to the menu at the start of the
document, to a higher level (section/chapter/book) in the same
documentation tree, to the Home Menu for the Documentation System, and
to the overall AIPS++ Home Page
</P> 
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="authorship">Accountability: </A> authorship and
copyright</H3> 
 
<H4>Who wrote it, and when?</H4> 

<P>For tutorials, explain files, specifications, memos and notes, give
the authorship, date and time of last modification <EM>just below the banner
heading at normal text size</EM>. For short documents, such as pages in a web
cluster, this information can be given less obtrusively at the bottom of
each page.  Use the &lt;ADDRESS&gt; tag for such fields, to ensure consistent
formatting in all our documents on the reader's browser. (Don't use bold
or italic tags alone for these data: we want to trigger the browser's
address-recognition tool.) &lt;BR&gt; tags are legal to make line breaks
within "address" fields, though not all browsers recognize this.
</P>

<P>The only way to date a document unambiguously for all readers is
to use the <EM>name</EM> of the month (abbreviated if necessary). The
international world has too many different styles for all-numeric dates
and we cannot expect new readers to know which we have adopted
internally for AIPS++ code! It's better not to confuse them.
</P>

<H4>Ownership</H4> 
<P>When a document is published on the World Wide Web, we expect its
source to be copied to other machines, at least for caching. This does
not mean that we are giving the reader the right to incorporate the text
in other documents (any more than buying a copy of a magazine or
newspaper gives a reader unlimited rights to reproduce its contents).
The copyright to all AIPS++ source, including the HTML, resides with
A.U.I. and a statement to this effect should eventually appear at the
end of every HTML document in the AIPS++ information system. The
standard format for this statement is: </P>
<PRE>Copyright &amp;#169; 1995,1998,1999,2000 Associated Universities Inc., Washington, D.C.
</PRE>
<P>The &amp;#169; entity displays the symbol &#169; in all truly
HTML-compliant browsers.
