// <synopsis>
// QtMouseToolState records the currently-active mouse button (if any)
// of each type of Qt mouse tool.  There may be a QtMouseToolBar for each
// QtDisplayPanel (and in principle each may display a different subset
// of all the possible tools, though this is not implemented yet (7/06)).
// However, each mouse button (Left, Middle, Right) may be assigned to
// at most one type of tool type, and that assignment should be the same
// on each QtMouseToolBar.
//
// To accomplish that, this class signals current button assignments
// whenever such assignments change.  All display panels and/or their mouse
// tool bars may connect to this signal to keep Toolbar button icons and the
// actual core library mouse tools (such as MWCZoomer) in sync.
//
// This button state is therefore also essentially global or static, but this
// class cannot be purely static because it must be a real QObject
// to send out such a signal.  Instead, there should be only one
// QtMouseToolState object (managed by the [one] QtViewer[Base] object),
// and all listeners should use that object for setting and responding to
// current mouse tool button state.
