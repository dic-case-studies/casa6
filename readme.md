## CASA 6

CASA 6 marks a major new chapter in CASA's development. With CASA 6, tools and
tasks will be available as Python wheels from a [PyPI repository](https://casa-pip.nrao.edu/).
These wheels can then be installed in any version of Python 3.6. In time CASA will
provide wheels for other versions of Python.

CASA 6 divides CASA's functionality into two Python packages:

  * [casatools](casatools/readme.md) -- the C++ tools with a minimal Python layer
  * [casatasks](casatasks/readme.md) -- a pure Python layer which provides a higher level of abstraction
