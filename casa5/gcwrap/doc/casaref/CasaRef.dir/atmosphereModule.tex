%%\ahinclude{ms.g}
\begin{ahdescription}

This is a thin-interface to Juan R. Padro's proprietary ATM library
atmlib.  The atm library can be used to calculate atmospheric opacity
and phase, and to perform radiative transfer calculations.  In CASA,
it is used for calibration, phase correction and for simulations.  See
\htmladdnormallink{Juan Padro's web page}{\atmURL} for futher information about the library structure and for
information about other uses.
