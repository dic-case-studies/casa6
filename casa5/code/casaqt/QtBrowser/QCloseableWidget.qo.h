// <synopsis>
// A QCloseableWidget is a convenience class that adds a "close" functionality
// to any QWidget subclass.  It does this by providing methods (such as getting,
// setting, and clearing the QWidget) and signals indicating when the close
// button has been pressed.  <b>Important</b>: it is the responsibility of the
// caller/parent to actually close the object; the QCloseableWidget just
// provides the signal.
// </synopsis>

    // the close button.  If the text is empty, the default close button text
    // is displayed.
