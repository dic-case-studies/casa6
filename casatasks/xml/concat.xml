<task category="manipulation" name="concat" type="function">
<shortdescription>Concatenate several visibility data sets.</shortdescription>
<description>
The list of data sets given in the vis argument are chronologically
concatenated into an output data set in concatvis, i.e. the data sets
in vis are first ordered by the time of their earliest integration and
then concatenated. If concatvis already exists (e.g., it is the same
as the first input data set), then the other input data sets will be
appended to the concatvis data set.There is no limit to the number of
input data sets.
   
If there are fields whose direction agrees within the direction will
be the one from the chronologically first input MS. Spectral windows
for each data set with the same chanelization, and within a specified
frequency tolerance of another data set will be combined into one
spectral window.

If none of the input data sets have any scratch columns (model and
corrected columns), none are created in the concatvis.  Otherwise
these columns are created on output and initialized to their default
value (1 in model column, data in corrected column) for those data
with no input columns.

Each appended dataset is assigned a new observation id (provided the
entries in the observation table are indeed different).

  <param mustexist="true" name="vis" type="pathVec">
<shortdescription>Name of input visibility file</shortdescription>
<description>Name of input visibility file
                     default: none

                        Example:
                        vis='['src2.ms','ngc5921.ms','ngc315.ms']

  <param name="concatvis" type="string">
<shortdescription>Name of output visibility file</shortdescription>
<description>Name of visibility file that will contain the
concatenated data
                     default: none

                        Example: concatvis='outvis.ms'

                     Note: if this file exits on disk then the input
                     files are added to this file.  Otherwise the new
                     file contains the concatenated data. Be careful
                     here when concatenating to an existing file.

  <param name="freqtol" type="any">
<shortdescription>Frequency shift tolerance for considering data as the same spwid</shortdescription>
<description>Frequency shift tolerance for considering data as the
same spwid. The number of channels must also be the same.
                    Default: '' == 1 Hz

                       Example: freqtol='10MHz' will not combine spwid
                       unless they are within 10 MHz.

                    Note: This option is useful to combine spectral
                    windows with very slight frequency differences
                    caused by Doppler tracking, for example.

  <param name="dirtol" type="any">
<shortdescription>Direction shift tolerance for considering data as the same field</shortdescription>
<description>Direction shift tolerance for considering data as the
same field
                     Default: '' == 1 mas (milliarcsec)

                        Example: dirtol='1arcsec' will not combine
                        data for a field unless their phase center
                        differ by less than 1 arcsec.  

                     Note: If the field names are different in the
                     input data sets, the name in the output data set
                     will be the first relevant data set in the list.

<description>If true, fields with a different name are not merged even

<description>If true, sort by TIME in ascending order
                     Default: False (data in order as read in)

                        Example: timesort=True

                     Note: There is no constraint on data that is
                     simultaneously observed for more than one field;
                     for example multi-source correlation of VLBA
                     data.

                     Default:True (can be time consuming!)

                     If False, the result is an empty POINTING table.

  <param name="visweightscale" type="doubleVec">
<shortdescription>List of the weight scaling factors to be applied to the individual MSs</shortdescription>
<description>List of the weight scaling factors to be applied to the
individual MSs
                     Default: [] (empty list) - no scaling

                     The weights of the individual MSs will be scaled
                     in the concatenated output MS by the factors in
                     this list. SIGMA will be scaled by
                     1/sqrt(factor). Useful for handling heterogeneous
                     arrays. Use plotms to inspect the &quot;Wt&quot; column as
                     a reference for determining the scaling factors.
 
                        Example: [1.,3.,3.] - scale the weights of the
                        second and third MS by a factor 3 and the
                        SIGMA column of these MS by a factor
                        1/sqrt(3).

<description>Make sure that there is only one joint ephemeris for every field in this list
                     Default: '' (standard treatment of all ephemeris
                     fields)

                     By default, concat will only merge two ephemeris
                     fields if the first ephemeris covers the time
                     range of the second. Otherwise, two separate
                     fields with separate ephemerides are placed in
                     the output MS.
                     In order to override this behaviour and make
                     concat merge the non-overlapping or only
                     partially overlapping input ephemerides, the name
                     or id of the field in question needs to be placed
                     into the list in parameter
                     'forcesingleephemfield'.

                     Example: ['Neptune'] - will make sure that there
                     is only one joint ephemeris for field Neptune in
                     the output MS
