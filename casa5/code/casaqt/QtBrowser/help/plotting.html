                To do 2D plotting, have at least one table open and then open a plotter
                with the <b>Tools - Plot 2D (Ctrl+P)</b> command.<br/>
                <img src="qrc:/help/images/15-plot.png"/><br/><br/>

                On the plotter window, choose which table you will be plotting with and
                the rows you wish to plot.  You can then choose which fields will be used
                for the X and Y axes.  Note that only "plottable" fields can be used; for
                example, a String field could not be plotted.  For fields that contain
                array values of a fixed dimension, you can choose which "slice" of the
                array you want to plot.  Once the parameters have been chosen, there are
                two ways to plot: overplot or clear and plot.  Overplot will add the
                given plot to any pre-existing plots whereas clear and plot will clear
                any previous plots.  Note that overplotting means that all plots will be
                on the same scale, so you probably want to use similarly scaled data.
                There are also formatting options for the plot image itself.

<div class="highlighted2"><a name="2d_plotting:_tasks1"></a><h3>Apply Row Filter</h3></div>

                If there is a row filter on the table you are plotting (see
                Browsing:Tasks:Filter Rows), you have the option to apply this filter
                when plotting such that only rows that pass the filter are plotted.
                To apply the filter, check the "Apply Current Filter" box.

<div class="highlighted2"><a name="2d_plotting:_tasks2"></a><h3>Zooming</h3></div>

                Zooming can be accomplished by selecting the "Zoom" option in the
                hand tool option box.  The region to be zoomed in on is then selected
                using the mouse on the plot canvas.  This process can be repeated to
                zoom in as far as desired.  The zoomer uses a zoom "stack" such that it
                remembers all the zoom levels and is thus able to go back and forth in
                the stack.  For example, once zoomed in you can zoom out one level
                by clicking the "Out" button or in one level by clicking the "In"
                button.  Scrolling the mouse wheel will also move out and in in the
                zoom stack.  You can return to the topmost level by clicking the
                "Base" button or by right-clicking on the canvas.  Note that these
                actions are only available when the Zoom tool is selected.  Also
                note that if another plot is added to the canvas, the zoomer is
                reset.

<div class="highlighted2"><a name="2d_plotting:_tasks3"></a><h3>Panning</h3></div>

                Panning can be accomplished by selecting the "Pan" option in the
                hand tool option box.  The plot can then be panned by clicking
                and dragging the canvas to the desired position.  This process
                can be repeated to pan as far as desired.  To reset to the base
                position, click the "Reset" button.  Note that these actions are
                only available when the Pan tool is selected.  Also note that if
                anothe rplot is added to the canvas, the panner is reset.

<div class="highlighted2"><a name="2d_plotting:_tasks4"></a><h3>Selecting</h3></div>

                Selecting can be accomplished by selecting the "Select" option
                in the hand tool option box.  The region to be selected is then
                slsected using the mouse on the plot canvas.  Once a region has
                been selected, the following actions may be performed on it:
                <ul> <li>Locate: generates a list of all the rows that contain
                         points in the selected region.  A window is displayed
                         containing this information with the row numbers sorted.
                         Displayed rows can then be highlighted in the browser by
                         selecting the row to highlight and then clicking the
                         "Highlight in Browser" button.  The "Next" button can
                         be repeatedly clicked to move through the displayed rows.
                </li><li>Clear: clears the selected region from the plot.
                </li></ul><h3> </h3>
                
                Note that these actions are only available when the Select tool
                is selected.  Also note that if another plot is added to the
                canvas, the selected region is cleared.

<div class="highlighted2"><a name="2d_plotting:_tasks5"></a><h3>Save As Image</h3></div>

                To save the current plot as an image, first select the image format you
                wish to export as, then click the "Go" button.  You will be prompted to
                choose a file to save to.  If there are any problems during the export,
                an error dialog will appear; otherwise the export was successful.
